# Fetch published Wasm binaries by walking every package under
# `packages/registry/<name>/` that has both package.toml and build.toml.
#
# The resolver consumes the central binary index configured by
# `WASM_POSIX_BINARY_INDEX_URL`. For each package that has a
# publishable build source (`build.toml`) we run
#
#     cargo run -p xtask -- build-deps resolve <name> \
#         --arch <arch> --binaries-dir <repo>/binaries
#
# which (a) fetches+verifies the archive into the resolver's
# content-addressed cache (~/.cache/kandelo/...), and (b)
# places `binaries/programs/<arch>/<output>.wasm` symlinks pointing
# into the cache. Browser demos hardcode these paths.
#
# Packages without `build.toml` (kernel-test-programs, kind=source,
# libraries that ship only as link-time inputs) are skipped here.
# Kernel and userspace now have build.toml entries, so published
# release indexes can populate `binaries/kernel.wasm` and
# `binaries/userspace.wasm` for fresh checkouts and npm package
# preparation.
#
# Per-arch handling: read the optional `arches = ["wasm32", ...]`
# field from each package.toml. Default is `["wasm32"]`. For each
# declared arch we invoke `resolve --arch <arch>` once.
#
# Resolver fallback semantics: if an archive is unreachable, hash-
# mismatched, or has a stale `cache_key_sha`, `resolve` logs a
# warning and falls through to a source build. A source build that
# also fails surfaces as a non-zero exit; we collect the failures
# and report them at the end so one stuck package doesn't block the
# others.
#
# Flags:
#   --offline      Set `WASM_POSIX_OFFLINE=1` so the resolver refuses
#                  to hit the network. (No-op if every archive is
#                  already in the cache.)
#   --pr <N>       Force PR overlay handling. With Phase C the overlay
#                  lives at `packages/registry/<name>/package.pr.toml`,
#                  one file per package. The fetcher does NOT install
#                  overlays itself — that's Task 4's CI job. This
#                  flag is reserved for future use; today it warns
#                  and is otherwise a no-op.
#   --allow-stale  Accept partial fetch. The resolver already falls
#                  through to a source build on any verification
#                  failure (so individual archive-fetch failures are
#                  invisible), but a follow-up source build can also
#                  fail (e.g., a meta-package whose script reads a
#                  sibling source tree that hasn't been populated this
#                  run). Without --allow-stale, any per-package
#                  resolve failure exits 1 and aborts CI. With it,
#                  failures degrade to warnings and the script exits 0
#                  if any packages succeeded — matching the legacy
#                  behavior where a stale-but-present cache was usable
#                  even when the release was incomplete. CI callers
#                  rely on this: the matrix target's build runs in a
#                  later step and fails loudly if its actual deps are
#                  missing.
#   --fetch-only   Refuse resolver source-build fallback. CI
#                  materialization uses this after staging has had a
#                  chance to publish drifted package archives; stale or
#                  missing archives fail fast instead of compiling in
#                  the test gate.
#   -h / --help    Print this header.
#
# Env:
#   WASM_POSIX_BINARY_INDEX_URL
#                  Overrides every package's build.toml `[binary].index_url`.
#                  For PR staging, prefer invoking through
#                  `./run.sh --pr-staging fetch` so run.sh can discover
#                  and verify the current PR's staging index first.
#   WASM_POSIX_FETCH_SKIP_PKGS
#                  Space-separated package names to skip entirely.
#                  CI uses this for packages temporarily disabled from
#                  staging/prepare matrices so test-gate does not
#                  source-build them while materializing binaries.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every package resolved successfully (archive fetched OR
#      source-built fallback succeeded).
#   1  one or more packages failed to resolve; failure list is
#      printed to stderr.
#   2  bad arguments / missing prerequisite tool.
