## Test Verification

**ALL of these must pass before claiming "tests pass" or completing any branch:**

1. **Cargo tests** (kernel unit tests):
   ```bash
   cargo test -p wasm-posix-kernel --target aarch64-apple-darwin --lib
   ```
   Expected: 539+ tests pass, 0 failures.

2. **Vitest** (host integration tests):
   ```bash
   cd host && npx vitest run
   ```
   Expected: all test files pass (PHP tests skip if binary not built).

3. **musl libc-test suite** (C standard library conformance):
   ```bash
   scripts/run-libc-tests.sh
   ```
   Expected: 0 unexpected failures. `XFAIL` (expected failures) and `TIME` (timeouts) are acceptable. Any `FAIL` that is not `XFAIL` is a regression.

4. **Open POSIX Test Suite** (POSIX API conformance):
   ```bash
   scripts/run-posix-tests.sh
   ```
   Expected: 0 `FAIL` results. `UNRES` (unresolved) and `SKIP` are acceptable.

**Do not skip suites 3 and 4.** They catch regressions that unit tests miss — syscall behavior changes, ABI issues, and POSIX compliance problems only surface when running real C programs against the kernel.

5. **ABI snapshot check**:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/check-abi-version.sh
   ```
   Expected: exit 0. Rebuilds the kernel wasm, regenerates the structural snapshot (covering channel layout, syscall numbers, marshalled structs, and kernel-wasm exports), and fails if `abi/snapshot.json` drifts from source, or if the snapshot changed vs `origin/main` without either a matching `ABI_VERSION` bump in `crates/shared/src/lib.rs` or an additive-compatible ABI diff. See [docs/abi-versioning.md](docs/abi-versioning.md).

6. **Browser demo verification**: When fixing browser demo bugs, run `./run.sh browser` and manually verify the fix in a browser before claiming it works. Code reasoning alone is not sufficient — browser timing, service workers, and Wasm behavior must be observed.

## Kernel ABI stability — DO NOT change incompatibly without bumping `ABI_VERSION`

The kernel's binary interface to user programs is load-bearing: any silent incompatible change can corrupt memory in any binary compiled against an older kernel. **Every incompatible change to the following requires bumping `ABI_VERSION` in `crates/shared/src/lib.rs` and regenerating `abi/snapshot.json` in the same commit:**

- Channel header layout (`shared::channel::*`), channel data buffer, signal-delivery area.
- Syscall numbers (removals, renames, reassignments; additions are allowed without a bump if existing entries are unchanged).
- Existing marshalled `repr(C)` structs (`WasmStat`, `WasmDirent`, `WasmFlock`, `WasmTimespec`, `WasmPollFd`, `WasmStatfs`).
- `shared::abi::*` constants (custom section name, process-expected globals, export filter lists).
- The five `wpk_fork_*` export names + save buffer / frame layout emitted by `wasm-fork-instrument` (see [docs/fork-instrumentation.md](docs/fork-instrumentation.md)). The tool hardcodes saved-global offsets at instrument time; changing the layout and re-running old user binaries against a new kernel will corrupt the fork save path.
- Kernel-wasm exports (any existing `kernel_*` function signature change, global type/mutability change, or removed export that isn't on the toolchain denylist; additions are allowed without a bump if existing entries are unchanged).

**Workflow when you've changed something that might be ABI-affecting:**

```bash
bash scripts/check-abi-version.sh update   # regenerate abi/snapshot.json
git diff abi/snapshot.json                 # inspect — is this actually an ABI change?
# If it changes existing ABI surface: bump ABI_VERSION in crates/shared/src/lib.rs and commit both files together.
# If it is only additive-compatible: commit the snapshot without bumping ABI_VERSION.
bash scripts/check-abi-version.sh          # verify
```

The script is also run as step 5 of the test suite above. CI refuses to merge a change where the snapshot drifts from source, or where a no-bump snapshot diff changes existing ABI surface. See [docs/abi-versioning.md](docs/abi-versioning.md) for full policy, including what the structural check does *not* catch (e.g., semantic changes that don't shift offsets — reviewers must flag those).

## Performance Benchmarks

**When doing performance work, run ALL 5 suites on BOTH hosts (Node.js and browser).** Do not run only `syscall-io` or only one host — application-level suites exercise different syscall patterns, threading models, and I/O workloads that micro-benchmarks miss. If a suite skips because its binary is missing, build it before drawing conclusions.

### The 5 benchmark suites

| Suite | What it measures | Binary prerequisites |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `syscall-io` | Pipe/file throughput, syscall latency | `scripts/build-programs.sh` |
| `process-lifecycle` | fork, exec, clone, cold start | `scripts/build-programs.sh` |
| `erlang-ring` | BEAM VM message passing (1000 processes) | `bash packages/registry/erlang/build-erlang.sh` |
| `wordpress` | PHP CLI + WordPress HTTP first response | `bash packages/registry/php/build-php.sh` + WordPress checkout |
| `mariadb` | SQL bootstrap + query performance | `bash packages/registry/mariadb/build-mariadb.sh` |

Application suites require the SDK. The SDK is worktree-local: every
build script under `packages/registry/*/build-*.sh` sources
`sdk/activate.sh` to put `<worktree>/sdk/bin/` on PATH. No `npm link`
needed (and explicitly avoided — a global symlink can route a build
in one worktree to a sibling worktree's SDK source). `npm link` still
works for users who already have it.

### Running benchmarks

```bash
# All suites, Node.js host (3 rounds each, reports median)
npx tsx benchmarks/run.ts --rounds=3

# All suites, browser host (via Playwright)
npx tsx benchmarks/run.ts --host=browser --rounds=3

# Single suite (only when specifically asked)
npx tsx benchmarks/run.ts --suite=syscall-io

# Compare before/after
npx tsx benchmarks/compare.ts benchmarks/results/before.json benchmarks/results/after.json
```

Results are saved as JSON in `benchmarks/results/`. See [docs/profiling.md](docs/profiling.md) for detailed suite descriptions, metrics, and build prerequisites.

## Architecture

Centralized kernel mode only. One kernel Wasm instance serves all process workers via channel IPC (SharedArrayBuffer + Atomics). Programs are compiled with `channel_syscall.c`.

**The kernel MUST run in a dedicated worker thread on ALL platforms** — `worker_thread` on Node.js, Web Worker in browsers. Never instantiate `CentralizedKernelWorker` on the main thread. The main thread should only be a thin proxy for setup and I/O routing. Running the kernel on the main thread degrades syscall throughput by 3-4x due to event loop overhead.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for full architecture details.

## Two hosts: Browser AND Node.js — DUAL-HOST PARITY IS LOAD-BEARING

**Node.js and the Browser host are equals.** Neither is a primary; neither is a follower. Every fix, feature, and refactor that touches host-runtime behavior MUST land on both — in the **same PR**, not in a follow-up. A "we'll do the browser side later" PR is the bug. PRs that merge a one-sided fix have repeatedly broken production demos for users:

- **PR #388 (brk-base fix)** wired Node-only; browser spawn/exec call sites missed → mariadbd hang in the browser demo. Cleanup landed in PR #397 *weeks later*.
- **PR #410 (a_crash trap + worker exit message)** wired Node-only; browser host had no `{type:"exit"}` message handling on `handleSpawn`/`handleFork` and **no message listener at all on `handleExec`** → silent worker crashes during WordPress LAMP install hung the user's demo with no error indication.

These are not edge cases. They are the same failure mode repeated. The cost lands on users running `./run.sh browser`, who see a frozen demo with no error in console.

### Hard requirements when touching host code

A change is incomplete unless ALL of these hold:

1. **Symmetry check first.** Before writing any host-side change, run `grep -rn "<symbol>" host/ apps/browser-demos/` for every callsite of the affected function. Both trees should show parallel structure; if one is missing handlers the other has, that's the change.
2. **Both PRs of the wiring land in the same commit.** Don't merge a host-side change with a TODO/follow-up note for the other side. The follow-up will be lost — see PR #388/#397 above.
3. **Tests cover both paths.** A vitest test (Node) does not protect the browser path. Add a browser test under `packages/registry/<pkg>/test/**/*.spec.ts` (Playwright) or `apps/browser-demos/test/`, OR — at minimum — manually verify the affected demo via `./run.sh browser` per the [Test Verification](#test-verification) checklist (item 6: browser demo verification).
4. **PR description names both hosts.** The reviewer should not have to ask "what about the browser?" — the answer should be in the PR body, with the diff to prove it. If the answer is "browser doesn't need this," the PR must explain *why* (e.g., "browser uses a different mechanism that already handles this case, see X").

### Where the parallel implementations live

| Concern | Node.js | Browser |
|---|---|---|
| Host entry | `host/src/node-kernel-host.ts` | `host/src/browser-kernel-host.ts` |
| Worker entry / spawn / fork / exec / clone / exit / terminate | `host/src/node-kernel-worker-entry.ts` | `host/src/browser-kernel-worker-entry.ts` |
| Worker adapter | `host/src/worker-adapter.ts` | `host/src/worker-adapter-browser.ts` |
| Process-worker entry | shared: `host/src/worker-main.ts` |
| Kernel | shared: `host/src/kernel-worker.ts` (`CentralizedKernelWorker`) |

`host/src/kernel-worker.ts` and `host/src/worker-main.ts` are shared and cross-cutting — verify both runtimes still work after changes there.

### Reviewer prompt

When reviewing a change touching any of the files above, ask explicitly: ***"What does this look like on the OTHER host?"*** If the answer isn't an obvious diff hunk in the same PR, request changes. Reviewers should treat a one-sided host change as an incomplete PR, not a "ship and follow up."

## Performance: Do NOT Micro-Optimize the Syscall Hot Path

**Do not add "optimization" tables or shortcut logic to `kernel-worker.ts`.** Specifically, do not:

- Add syscall argument count tables to skip reading unused args (e.g., `SYSCALL_ARG_COUNTS`)
- Add syscall classification sets to conditionally skip post-syscall work (e.g., `IO_SYSCALLS` to skip `drainAndProcessWakeupEvents`)
- Cache `DataView` or `Int32Array` objects on channel structs to avoid re-creation
- Skip debug ring logging for "trivial" syscalls

These optimizations were benchmarked and **made performance worse across all application workloads** (WordPress, Erlang, MariaDB). The per-syscall overhead of `new DataView()`, reading 6 BigInt args, and unconditionally draining wakeup events is negligible compared to the actual Wasm kernel execution. The "optimizations" add branch misprediction overhead, risk correctness bugs (wrong syscall numbers → zeroed args → broken networking), and make the code harder to maintain.

The real performance lever is the **dedicated worker thread architecture** (`NodeKernelHost` / `BrowserKernel`), which provides 2x pipe throughput and 2.5x clone speed. Keep `kernel-worker.ts` simple and correct.

## Build

```bash
bash scripts/build-musl.sh   # Build the wasm32 musl sysroot (one-time / on overlay changes)
bash build.sh                # Build kernel wasm + host TypeScript + programs
scripts/build-programs.sh    # Re-build test/example C programs
```

**`bash build.sh` does NOT rebuild musl.** It rebuilds the kernel
(`crates/kernel/`), the host TS package (`host/dist/`), and — if
`programs/*.c` exists — user programs. After editing anything under
`libc/musl-overlay/` or `libc/glue/channel_syscall.c`, run
`scripts/build-musl.sh` first; otherwise user programs link against a
stale `sysroot/lib/libc.a` and the kernel-side and libc-side ABI
constants can drift silently. Vitest will pick up the stale binary and
fail with cryptic ESRCH / EINVAL errors.

**Future work:** make `build.sh` detect overlay-source mtime drift and
trigger a musl rebuild automatically. Tracked here so the next devloop
gotcha doesn't bite again — last bit during the SYS_SPAWN renumber
(commit `1da06b2cc`).

### Always use `scripts/dev-shell.sh`, not bare `nix develop`

The canonical entry to the dev shell is `scripts/dev-shell.sh`. It wraps
`nix develop --ignore-environment` with a curated `--keep` list (HOME,
TERM, INPUT_*, GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_*) so only flake-declared deps are
visible. Bare `nix develop` inherits the host PATH — every host tool
silently leaks in, and the build "works on my machine" while a CI
runner without the same Homebrew/apt packages explodes. PR #406's
force-rebuild iterations diagnosed exactly this class of bug
(/usr/bin/curl, /opt/homebrew/bin/python3, /usr/bin/perl, makeinfo,
rsync, jq, …) — all caught by switching to pure mode.

Usage:

```bash
scripts/dev-shell.sh bash scripts/build-musl.sh   # one-shot
scripts/dev-shell.sh bash                         # interactive shell
```

CI workflows (`.github/workflows/force-rebuild.yml`,
`staging-build.yml`, `prepare-merge.yml`) all invoke build steps via
`bash scripts/dev-shell.sh ...`. To add a new env-var to the keep-list,
edit `scripts/dev-shell.sh` once — single source of truth.

If a build fails with "command not found" inside the dev shell, the
correct fix is to add the package to `flake.nix`, not to expand
`--keep`. `--keep` is for workflow context (auth, dispatch inputs),
not for tools.

## Package system

Every artifact under `packages/registry/<name>/` is a **package** with two
TOML files:
- **`package.toml`** — the **recipe** (project-agnostic): name,
  version, source pin, license, deps, `[build].script_path`.
- **`build.toml`** — this project's **build + publish state**:
  `script_path`, `repo_url`, `commit`, `revision`, and `[binary]`
  pointing at where binaries are published (typically
  `index_url = "https://.../binaries-abi-v{abi}/index.toml"`).

Archive URLs are NOT in either of those files. They live in a
per-release `index.toml` ledger, keyed by `(name, version, arch)`.
The resolver (`cargo xtask build-deps ...`) fetches the index,
looks up the entry, downloads the archive, and verifies. No central
lockfile (no `binaries.lock`, no `manifest.json`). See
[docs/plans/2026-05-13-binary-resolution-via-index-ledger-design.md](docs/plans/2026-05-13-binary-resolution-via-index-ledger-design.md)
for the full design.

**Hard rules:**

- **Never hand-edit `index.toml`.** It's mutated atomically by
  per-matrix-build jobs running `scripts/index-update.sh` under a
  workflow-level state-lock. A manual edit will be clobbered by the
  next matrix run. For a one-shot recovery (composing the initial
  ledger from existing archives, e.g. during a migration), use
  `scripts/compose-initial-index.sh <target-tag> <abi>`.
- **`build.toml.index_url` should template `{abi}`**, not hardcode the
  ABI generation. The resolver substitutes `{abi}` with `ABI_VERSION`
  from `crates/shared/src/lib.rs` at fetch time, so a single
  build.toml survives ABI bumps.
- **Bumping `build.toml.revision = N` invalidates every cached
  archive for that package.** Bump only when output bytes
  legitimately change (build flag tweaks, asyncify pass, etc.).
  Don't bump for doc-only changes — that triggers a needless
  rebuild across the matrix. Revision lives in `build.toml`
  because it's a publish-time counter (project state), not a
  recipe property — `package.toml` doesn't carry it.
- **ABI bumps (`ABI_VERSION` in `crates/shared/src/lib.rs`) require
  a new release tag.** v(N-1) archives don't satisfy v(N)
  verifications. The matrix flow handles this automatically: each
  matrix entry publishes its archive + index entry to
  `binaries-abi-v<N>/` atomically; the v(N-1) release stays as
  historical state.
- **Multi-output packages land under `binaries/programs/<arch>/<pkg>/<out>`,
  single-output under `binaries/programs/<arch>/<out>`.** Never
  hardcode this convention in scripts; query via
  `xtask build-deps output-path <pkg> <wasm-basename>` (or in run.sh,
  use the `pkg_has_output` helper). See `run.sh`'s `has_<pkg>` block
  for the contract.

**Common tasks:**

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Resolve a single package (fetch via index or source-build, cache) | `cargo xtask build-deps resolve <name>` |
| Materialize all consumer-facing symlinks under `binaries/` | `scripts/fetch-binaries.sh --allow-stale` |
| Where does a package's output land? | `cargo xtask build-deps output-path <name> <wasm-basename>` |
| Stage a single archive (matrix-build's per-entry step) | `cargo xtask archive-stage --package packages/registry/<name> --arch <arch> --out <dir>` |
| Force a re-publish of selected packages | dispatch `.github/workflows/force-rebuild.yml` with the comma list |
| Atomically publish one archive + index entry (matrix-build sequence) | `scripts/index-update.sh --target-tag <tag> --package <p> --version <v> --revision <r> --arch <a> --status success --archive-path <f> --archive-name <n> --cache-key-sha <s>` |
| Compose initial index.toml from existing archives (migration only) | `scripts/compose-initial-index.sh <target-tag> <abi>` |

**When something looks wrong:**

- Source build firing for a package you expect to be cached →
  `cargo xtask build-deps resolve <name>` logs the reason. Common
  causes: cache_key_sha mismatch (recipe drift since the archive was
  published; bump `build.toml.revision` if intentional, or wait for
  CI to re-publish), the `index.toml` entry's status is `failed`
  with no fallback, or the index fetch itself failed (offline /
  unreachable URL).
- `fetch-binaries.sh` reports N failures → those packages will
  source-build on the matrix runners. With `--allow-stale` (CI
  default) the script still exits 0 since per-target builds gate
  failures themselves.
- `has_<pkg>` returns false even though the archive is present →
  check whether the resolver-driven `pkg_has_output` helper agrees;
  if it does but `has_<pkg>` doesn't, that's a stale hardcoded path.

**Reference docs (don't reinvent):**

- **`docs/package-management.md`** — schema, resolver, build-script
  contract, host-tool requirements. The reference manual.
- **`docs/binary-releases.md`** — operational doc for the release
  flow + `index.toml` shape + consumer-side fetch behavior.
- **`docs/abi-versioning.md`** — when `ABI_VERSION` must bump.
- **`docs/plans/2026-05-13-binary-resolution-via-index-ledger-design.md`** —
  why the index-ledger split (vs the prior `[binary]`-in-package.toml
  shape), with the four-bug postmortem.

## Cross-Compilation and Configure Scripts

We cross-compile C libraries for wasm32 using `wasm32posix-cc`. Autoconf `configure` scripts often run feature-detection checks (e.g., `AC_CHECK_FUNCS`) that test against the **host** system's libraries rather than the wasm sysroot. This produces incorrect results — functions like `feenableexcept` may exist on macOS/Linux but not in our musl-based wasm sysroot.

When writing build scripts that call `configure`, explicitly override any checks for functions not available in the wasm sysroot using autoconf cache variables:

```bash
ac_cv_func_feenableexcept=no \
"$SRC_DIR/configure" \
    --host=wasm32-unknown-none \
    CC=wasm32posix-cc \
    ...
```

Do not rely on configure's auto-detection when cross-compiling. If a build fails due to missing functions, check whether configure incorrectly detected a host-only feature and add the appropriate `ac_cv_*=no` override.

## Documentation

Every PR that adds or changes user-facing features, APIs, or behavior must include corresponding documentation updates. Check these locations:

- **`docs/architecture.md`** — Update when changing kernel design, host runtime, VFS, networking, or process model
- **`docs/posix-status.md`** — Update when adding, completing, or changing syscall implementations
- **`docs/sdk-guide.md`** — Update when changing SDK tools or compilation workflow
- **`docs/porting-guide.md`** — Update when changing how software is ported or run
- **`docs/browser-support.md`** — Update when changing browser capabilities or limitations
- **`docs/package-management.md`** — Update when changing the package schema, resolver behavior, or build-script contract
- **`docs/binary-releases.md`** — Update when changing the release flow, `index.toml` shape, or `fetch-binaries.sh` consumer path
- **`README.md`** — Update when adding major features, new ported software, or changing project structure

Do not skip documentation. If a feature is worth implementing, it is worth documenting.
