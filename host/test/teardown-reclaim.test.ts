/*
 * Cross-engine teardown-reclamation test — runs under BOTH V8 (Node, via
 * `vitest`) and JSC (Bun, via `bun x vitest`). Exercises the shared
 * `killAllBlockedForTeardown` + the host `handleDestroy` wake/drain path on
 * both engines. See docs/jsc-terminate-atomics-wait-workaround.md.
 *
 * [JSC-TERMINATE-ATOMICS-WAIT-LEAK]
 *
 * The actual memory/thread reclamation (which only JSC gets wrong) is only
 * measurable out-of-process via RSS (Playwright). What we assert here is the
 * observable, engine-agnostic proxy: a daemon parked in a blocking syscall
 * (Atomics.wait on its channel) is WOKEN into a cooperative exit on destroy —
 * exit status 137 (128 + SIGKILL, from the glue's kernel_exit) — rather than
 * being force-terminated while parked. If the wake path regresses, the daemon
 * is force-terminated (a synthesized crash status) and/or the drain times out,
 * both of which fail the assertions below.
