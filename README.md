# Kandelo

Kandelo is a POSIX-compatible multi-process kernel for WebAssembly that runs command-line tools, server stacks, and early graphical demos in the browser or Node.js with syscall-level compatibility.

**Live demo**: [Open Kandelo in the browser](https://automattic.github.io/kandelo/)

**User guide**: [Read the browser and VFS guide](https://automattic.github.io/kandelo/guide/)

***ATTENTION:*** This repo may contain .wasm binary builds in its history. In the future, history will likely be rewritten to remove these as they are offloaded to a better data store.

## Architecture

A single shared kernel serves all processes via channel IPC (SharedArrayBuffer + Atomics):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  User Programs (C → Wasm)               │
│  Each in its own Web Worker             │
│  Linked against musl libc + glue        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Kernel (Rust → Wasm)                   │
│  One instance, all processes            │
│  Syscalls, fd table, pipes, signals,    │
│  sockets, PTY, memory management        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Host Runtime (TypeScript)              │
│  Node.js: fs, net, crypto               │
│  Browser: SharedArrayBuffer FS, fetch   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Kernel** (Rust → Wasm) — 170+ syscall implementations. One instance manages all processes via a `ProcessTable`.
- **Host** (TypeScript) — Loads kernel and user Wasm binaries, provides host I/O, bridges blocking syscalls to async APIs via `Atomics.waitAsync`.
- **Glue** (C) — Syscall dispatcher compiled into every user program. Translates musl's `__syscall` ABI into channel writes that the kernel reads.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full architecture reference.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust nightly** (for `build-std` and atomics) — pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`
- **LLVM 21+** with `clang` and `wasm-ld` (macOS: `brew install llvm`)
- **Node.js** 24+

Or use the Nix flake (see [Using Nix](#using-nix) below) and skip per-tool installs.

## Using Nix

A `flake.nix` provides a reproducible dev shell with the pinned Rust nightly,
Nix's LLVM 21 package set, Node 24, minimal Erlang 28, and the
autotools/cmake/binaryen/wabt stack the build scripts need. With
[Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) installed (flakes enabled —
Determinate Systems Nix has them on by default):

```bash
scripts/dev-shell.sh bash            # interactive pure shell
# or
scripts/dev-shell.sh bash build.sh   # one-shot
```

The `shellHook` exports `LLVM_BIN` / `LLVM_PREFIX` / `LLVM_VERSION` so the
build scripts pick up the Nix-provided LLVM toolchain. It also exports the
LLVM source paths used to rebuild the repo's libcxx package reproducibly.
The first shell entry downloads the toolchain (~10–15 min); subsequent entries
are near-instant.

## Quick Start

### Install published packages

For consumers that do not need to rebuild Kandelo itself, the npm
packages are the easiest entry point:

```bash
npm install wasm-posix-host wasm-posix-sdk
```

`wasm-posix-host` ships the compiled host runtime JS, worker entry
points, `kernel.wasm`, and `rootfs.vfs`. `wasm-posix-sdk` ships the
compiler wrappers, musl sysroot, and host glue files used when linking
your own C/C++ programs. You still need LLVM 21+ on `PATH` (or
`WASM_POSIX_LLVM_DIR`) because the SDK wraps clang rather than
bundling a native compiler.

From a source checkout, `npm run pack:packages` builds npm tarballs
after `bash scripts/build-musl.sh` and `bash build.sh` have produced
the sysroot, kernel, and rootfs artifacts.

### 1. Build the kernel

```bash
git submodule update --init libc/musl

# Build musl sysroot (first time only)
bash scripts/build-musl.sh

# Build kernel Wasm + TypeScript host
bash build.sh
```

This builds the kernel from source. Library dependencies (zlib, openssl,
sqlite, libcxx, etc.) and ported programs (vim, git, php, etc.) are resolved
on demand by `cargo xtask build-deps resolve <name>`, which prefers
the per-user cache, then falls back to the published binary release at
[`binaries-abi-v<ABI_VERSION>`](https://github.com/Automattic/kandelo/releases),
then to a source build via the per-library `build-<name>.sh`. See
[docs/package-management.md](docs/package-management.md) for the
full schema, resolution order, and release-archive contract.

If you prefer to skip cargo-driven dep resolution and pull every
pre-built artifact at once, run `bash scripts/fetch-binaries.sh` after
`bash build.sh`. It walks every `packages/registry/<pkg>/package.toml`
with a `[binary.<arch>]` block and resolves the archives into the
content-addressed cache plus `binaries/programs/<arch>/` symlinks.

On PR branches, CI publishes temporary binaries to
`pr-<PR_NUMBER>-staging`. Use `./run.sh --pr-staging browser` or
`WASM_POSIX_USE_PR_STAGING=1 ./run.sh browser` to consume that staging
index locally without editing `build.toml`. A manually set
`WASM_POSIX_BINARY_INDEX_URL` still takes precedence.

If you are editing a package's `package.toml` to iterate locally, the
resolver detects the cache-key mismatch, logs a warning, and falls
through to a source build via the package's `build-<name>.sh` —
no flag needed. See [Iterating on a package
locally](docs/package-management.md#iterating-on-a-package-locally).

### 2. Install the SDK

```bash
cd sdk && npm link
```

This installs 8 CLI tools that wrap LLVM for the `wasm32-posix` target:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `wasm32posix-cc` | C compiler |
| `wasm32posix-c++` | C++ compiler |
| `wasm32posix-ar` | Static archive tool |
| `wasm32posix-ranlib` | Archive index generator |
| `wasm32posix-nm` | Symbol lister |
| `wasm32posix-strip` | Symbol stripper (no-op) |
| `wasm32posix-pkg-config` | pkg-config with sysroot awareness |
| `wasm32posix-configure` | Autoconf configure wrapper |

See [docs/sdk-guide.md](docs/sdk-guide.md) for detailed SDK usage.

### 3. Compile and run a C program

```bash
wasm32posix-cc examples/hello.c -o hello.wasm
npx tsx examples/run-example.ts hello
```

### 4. Try Kandelo in the browser

```bash
# Build VFS images + start dev server (run.sh handles dependencies)
./run.sh browser

# Or manually:
cd apps/browser-demos
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5401` to use the Kandelo UI. The network lab at `http://127.0.0.1:5401/pages/network/` boots multiple local Kandelo machines in one browser session and exercises POSIX UDP/TCP with GNU Netcat (`nc`) and `curl`.

The browser app routes cross-origin fetches through the service worker and
defaults to the main WordPress Playground CORS proxy:
`https://wordpress-playground-cors-proxy.net/?`. To test an alternate proxy in
dev, preview, or production builds, set `VITE_CORS_PROXY_URL` before starting or
building the browser app:

```bash
cd apps/browser-demos
VITE_CORS_PROXY_URL='https://your-proxy.example/?' npm run dev
```

Proxy prefixes ending in a bare `?` receive the raw target URL. Other prefix
forms, such as `https://your-proxy.example/cors?url=`, receive a
percent-encoded target URL. If you change the proxy while a service worker is
already active, reload the page; clearing site data may be needed if the browser
keeps an older service worker around.

Browser Kandelo supports local loopback and virtual machine-to-machine UDP/TCP. External raw TCP/UDP sockets are still constrained by the browser sandbox and require fetch, service-worker, proxy, or future WebRTC-backed transports behind the POSIX socket layer.

The browser UI uses pre-built **VFS images** - binary filesystem snapshots that load instantly at runtime. See [docs/browser-support.md](docs/browser-support.md#vfs-images) for details.

## How It Works

1. **Compilation**: C source → clang (wasm32-unknown-unknown) → linked against musl `libc.a` + glue layer. The glue translates musl's `__syscall(number, args...)` into typed writes to a SharedArrayBuffer channel.

2. **Loading**: The TypeScript host instantiates the kernel Wasm module with host I/O imports, then creates process workers that each get their own Wasm memory with a channel region.

3. **Syscall execution**: When user code calls e.g. `open("/etc/hosts", O_RDONLY)`:
   - musl `open()` → `__syscall(SYS_openat, AT_FDCWD, path, flags, mode)`
   - Glue writes syscall number + args to the channel, then `Atomics.store(status, SYSCALL_READY)` + `Atomics.notify()`
   - Kernel worker wakes, reads channel, dispatches to `sys_open()`, writes result back
   - Glue resumes with the return value (fd or negative errno)

4. **Multi-process**: `fork()` uses `wasm-fork-instrument` to snapshot and restore the Wasm call stack. The host copies process memory to a new Web Worker, and the child resumes from the fork point. `exec()` replaces the process image by terminating the old worker and starting a new one with fresh memory. Cross-process pipes, signals, and locks are coordinated through the shared kernel instance.

## License

This project uses a split license model:

- **GPL-2.0-or-later** — The platform (kernel, host runtime, SDK, build scripts, examples)
- **MIT** — Runtime library components linked into user programs (libc/musl-overlay/ and libc/glue/)

You can compile and run your own programs — including proprietary ones — without the GPL applying to your code. The runtime code linked into your program is MIT-licensed, and the kernel communicates via IPC, not linking.
