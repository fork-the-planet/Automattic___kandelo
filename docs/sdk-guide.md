# SDK Guide

The wasm-posix-sdk provides a cross-compilation toolchain for building C/C++ programs that run on Kandelo. It wraps LLVM tools with the correct flags for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and links against the musl libc sysroot.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **LLVM 21+** with clang and wasm-ld:
   - macOS: `brew install llvm`
   - Ubuntu: `apt install llvm clang lld`
   - Or use the Nix dev shell wrapper (`scripts/dev-shell.sh bash` from the
     repo root) — provides LLVM 21 plus the rest of the toolchain, no per-tool
     install needed.
     See the README's "Using Nix" section.
2. **musl sysroot**. If you installed `wasm-posix-sdk` from npm, the
   package already contains the published sysroot and glue files. If
   you are working from a source checkout, build them locally:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init libc/musl
   bash scripts/build-musl.sh
   ```
3. **Kernel built**:
   ```bash
   bash build.sh
   ```

### Install the SDK

```bash
npm install -D wasm-posix-sdk

# or, from a source checkout:
cd sdk
npm link
```

This makes 8 CLI tools available globally:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `wasm32posix-cc` | C compiler (wraps clang) |
| `wasm32posix-c++` | C++ compiler (wraps clang++) |
| `wasm32posix-ar` | Static archive tool (wraps llvm-ar) |
| `wasm32posix-ranlib` | Archive index generator (wraps llvm-ranlib) |
| `wasm32posix-nm` | Symbol lister (wraps llvm-nm) |
| `wasm32posix-strip` | Symbol stripper (no-op for Wasm) |
| `wasm32posix-pkg-config` | pkg-config with sysroot awareness |
| `wasm32posix-configure` | Autoconf `./configure` wrapper |

### LLVM Discovery

The SDK finds LLVM in this order:

1. `$WASM_POSIX_LLVM_DIR` environment variable (path to LLVM bin directory)
2. `clang` on `$PATH` (tested for wasm32 support — covers the Nix dev shell,
   which puts the pinned LLVM 21 first on `PATH`)
3. `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin` (macOS Homebrew)
4. `/usr/lib/llvm-*/bin` (Linux, highest version)

### Glue and Sysroot Discovery

The SDK locates `libc/glue/` and `sysroot/` in this order:

1. `$WASM_POSIX_GLUE_DIR` / `$WASM_POSIX_SYSROOT` env vars (explicit overrides)
2. Walk up from `process.cwd()` looking for `libc/glue/abi_constants.h` — anchors to the project root the user is building from
3. Fall back to the SDK's sibling-repository directory (the `..` of the npm-linked package)

The cwd-walk-up step matters when the SDK is `npm link`-ed: the global `wasm32posix-cc` symlink points at whichever worktree last ran `npm link`, but libc/glue/sysroot must come from the worktree the user is actively building in (otherwise programs link against a different `ABI_VERSION` than the kernel they will run on). If you keep multiple worktrees, you do not need to re-`npm link` when switching between them — the SDK resolves libc/glue/sysroot from your shell's cwd.

## Compiling Programs

### Simple C program

```bash
# Compile and link in one step
wasm32posix-cc hello.c -o hello.wasm

# Run it
npx tsx examples/run-example.ts hello.wasm
```

### Compile-only (produce .o)

```bash
wasm32posix-cc -c foo.c -o foo.o
wasm32posix-cc -c bar.c -o bar.o
wasm32posix-cc foo.o bar.o -o program.wasm
```

### With optimization

```bash
wasm32posix-cc -O2 program.c -o program.wasm
```

### C++ programs

```bash
wasm32posix-c++ program.cpp -o program.wasm
```

### Linking C++ programs (with exceptions)

C++ programs link against libc++ + libc++abi. Both are produced by
the libcxx package (`packages/registry/libcxx/`) and resolved automatically
by `cargo xtask build-deps resolve libcxx`. LLVM libunwind is statically
bundled into `libc++abi.a`, so:

```bash
wasm32posix-c++ -fwasm-exceptions main.cpp -lc++ -lc++abi -o app.wasm
```

works out of the box — `_Unwind_*` symbols resolve internally, no
separate `-lunwind`.

`-fwasm-exceptions` is required for clang to lower C++ `try`/`catch`
to wasm-EH `try_table` / `catch_ref` instructions. Without it, catch
handlers are dead-code-eliminated and `throw` hangs at runtime.

### Building static libraries

```bash
wasm32posix-cc -c lib_a.c -o lib_a.o
wasm32posix-cc -c lib_b.c -o lib_b.o
wasm32posix-ar rcs libfoo.a lib_a.o lib_b.o
wasm32posix-cc main.c -L. -lfoo -o program.wasm
```

### With dynamic loading (dlopen)

```bash
# Build main program with dlopen support
wasm32posix-cc -ldl main.c -o main.wasm

# Build shared library
wasm32posix-cc -shared -fPIC plugin.c -o plugin.so
```

## What the SDK Does

### Compiler flags injected automatically

```
--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown    # Wasm target triple
-matomics                          # Enable atomics (SharedArrayBuffer)
-mbulk-memory                      # Enable bulk memory operations
-mexception-handling               # Enable Wasm exception handling
-mllvm -wasm-enable-sjlj           # Enable setjmp/longjmp
# Modern wasm-EH lowering (try_table/catch_ref) is LLVM's default
# since version ≥17; we no longer override with `-wasm-use-legacy-eh=true`
# (removed in commit 9 of the fork-instrument mega-PR, 2026-05-14).
-fno-trapping-math                 # Non-trapping FP (Wasm requirement)
--sysroot=<path>                   # musl sysroot
```

### Linker flags injected automatically

```
-nostdlib                          # Don't use system libc
-Wl,--entry=_start                 # Entry point
-Wl,--import-memory                # Memory provided by host
-Wl,--shared-memory                # Enable SharedArrayBuffer
-Wl,--max-memory=1073741824        # 1GB max memory
-Wl,--global-base=1114112          # Data segment start
-Wl,--no-stack-first               # LLVM 22+: preserve stack-after-data layout
-Wl,--allow-undefined              # Host imports are resolved at load time
-Wl,--export-table                 # Export function table (for dlopen)
-Wl,--export=__stack_pointer       # Required for fork/thread support
-Wl,--export=__tls_base            # Required for TLS
-Wl,--export=__wasm_init_tls       # TLS initialization
```

### Files linked automatically

When linking an executable (not compile-only), the SDK adds:
- `libc/glue/channel_syscall.c` — syscall dispatcher
- `libc/glue/compiler_rt.c` — soft-float and 64-bit builtins
- `sysroot/lib/crt1.o` — C runtime startup
- `sysroot/lib/libc.a` — musl libc

### Sysroot platform libraries

`scripts/build-musl.sh` also builds Kandelo's platform graphics shims into the
wasm32 sysroot:

| Library | pkg-config name | Purpose |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| `sysroot/lib/libdrm.a` | `libdrm` | DRM/KMS wrapper entry points and ioctl packing |
| `sysroot/lib/libgbm.a` | `gbm` | GBM device and buffer-object helpers |
| `sysroot/lib/libEGL.a` | `egl` | EGL setup over `/dev/dri/renderD128` |
| `sysroot/lib/libGLESv2.a` | `glesv2` | GLES2/3 command-buffer encoder |

Programs should reference these through `wasm32posix-pkg-config`, for example:

```bash
wasm32posix-cc -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE \
  $(wasm32posix-pkg-config --cflags libdrm gbm egl glesv2) \
  app.c \
  $(wasm32posix-pkg-config --libs gbm libdrm egl glesv2) \
  -lm -o app.wasm
```

These libraries are part of the sysroot contract. They are not standalone
package dependencies and they are not outputs of the kernel package. A package
that links against them should declare the package's resulting executable or
VFS image as its output, and include the relevant sysroot/glue sources and
build scripts in `build.toml.inputs` so binary cache keys change when the
library ABI or implementation changes.

### Pthread slot limit

Executable builds also declare the process's pthread concurrency limit through the exported `__wasm_posix_thread_slots` function:

- `--kandelo-thread-slots=N` or `--wasm-posix-thread-slots=N` emits an explicit declaration. `N` may be `-1` to use the host default, `0` to allow no pthreads, or a positive exact concurrent pthread count.
- If the flag is omitted, the SDK emits `0` only when it can conservatively prove the link has no thread creation, dynamic libraries, `dlopen`, or uncertain runtime pthread use.
- Otherwise the SDK emits `-1`, so the host uses its configured default. The built-in default is 1024, an intentionally arbitrary high limit meant to avoid pthread availability problems for most programs now that slots are reserved on demand. Hosts can lower or raise it by creating the kernel worker with `defaultThreadSlots`.

The count is a resource limit, not a static memory slab reservation. The host dynamically reserves each four-page pthread control slot when `pthread_create()` succeeds and reuses exited slots within the same process.

### Flags silently ignored

These flags are common in build systems but irrelevant for Wasm:
- `-pthread`, `-lpthread` (threads are host-managed)
- `-fPIE`, `-pie` (no position-independent executables in Wasm)
- `-lrt`, `-lresolv`, `-lm`, `-lcrypt`, `-lutil` (all in musl libc.a)
- `-rdynamic`, `-Wl,-Bsymbolic`
- `-Wl,-rpath,*`, `-Wl,-soname,*`, `-Wl,--version-script*`

## Autoconf Projects

Use `wasm32posix-configure` to run `./configure` with the correct cross-compilation settings:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
wasm32posix-configure
make
```

This sets:
- `CC=wasm32posix-cc`
- `CXX=wasm32posix-c++`
- `AR=wasm32posix-ar`
- `RANLIB=wasm32posix-ranlib`
- `NM=wasm32posix-nm`
- `STRIP=wasm32posix-strip`
- `--host=wasm32-unknown-none`
- `--build` (auto-detected from host system)

### Example: building dash

```bash
cd /tmp
git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dash/dash.git
cd dash
autoreconf -i
wasm32posix-configure --enable-static
make
# Output: src/dash (Wasm binary)
```

## CMake Projects

For CMake, create a toolchain file:

```cmake
# wasm32-posix-toolchain.cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR wasm32)

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER wasm32posix-cc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER wasm32posix-c++)
set(CMAKE_AR wasm32posix-ar)
set(CMAKE_RANLIB wasm32posix-ranlib)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
```

Then:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=wasm32-posix-toolchain.cmake
cmake --build build
```

### Example: building Redis

```bash
cd /tmp
curl -LO https://github.com/redis/redis/archive/7.2.7.tar.gz
tar xzf 7.2.7.tar.gz
cd redis-7.2.7

# Redis uses plain Makefile, not CMake
make CC=wasm32posix-cc AR=wasm32posix-ar RANLIB=wasm32posix-ranlib \
     MALLOC=libc SERVER_CFLAGS=
# Then run `wasm-fork-instrument` on the linked output (see "Fork
# instrumentation" below). No special LDFLAGS are needed — the tool
# auto-discovers fork-path functions; there's no onlylist to pass.
```

See `packages/registry/redis/build-redis.sh` for the complete build script.

## Fork instrumentation (`wasm-fork-instrument`)

Programs that call `fork()` or fork-like APIs need the in-tree
`wasm-fork-instrument` tool to save/restore the Wasm call stack across fork.
Fork-like APIs include `vfork()`, `_Fork()`, shell pipelines, command
substitution, `system()`, `popen()`, and helper processes implemented through
fork.

This step is mandatory for fork-using programs. Do not use Binaryen Asyncify,
do not tolerate missing instrumentation, and do not publish binaries that
export legacy `asyncify_*` symbols.

```bash
# Compile normally
wasm32posix-cc program.c -o program.wasm

# (Optional) shrink with wasm-opt -O2 first; must run BEFORE the instrument
# step since fork-instrument hardcodes mutable-global offsets.
wasm-opt -O2 program.wasm -o program.wasm

# Apply fork instrumentation. Auto-discovers fork-path functions via
# call-graph analysis from the kernel.kernel_fork import — no onlylist
# file needed. The wrapper builds the tool on demand if tools/bin is absent.
"$REPO_ROOT/scripts/run-wasm-fork-instrument.sh" program.wasm -o program.wasm.instr
mv program.wasm.instr program.wasm
```

The tool emits five `wpk_fork_*` exports that the host runtime drives during
fork. Programs that don't use fork can skip this step entirely, but a program
that reaches `kernel_fork` without complete `wpk_fork_*` instrumentation is
invalid.

See [`docs/fork-instrumentation.md`](fork-instrumentation.md) for the
exported ABI, save-buffer format, and the dispatch-scheme decisions.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `WASM_POSIX_LLVM_DIR` | Path to LLVM bin directory |
| `WASM_POSIX_SYSROOT` | Override sysroot path (default: `<repo>/sysroot`) |
| `WASM_POSIX_GLUE_DIR` | Override glue directory (default: `<repo>/libc/glue`) |

## Running Programs

### Node.js

```bash
# Using the example runner (handles fork, exec, threads)
npx tsx examples/run-example.ts program.wasm [args...]

# Or use the host API directly
node --experimental-strip-types your-script.ts
```

### Browser

See the [Porting Guide](porting-guide.md) for preparing browser-facing package images.

## Tips

- **Don't add `-pthread`**: Thread creation is host-managed via `clone()`. The SDK silently ignores `-pthread`.
- **Use `-O2` or `-Os`**: Unoptimized Wasm is significantly slower and larger.
- **Check build script examples**: `packages/registry/` contains complete build scripts for 12 real-world libraries including autoconf, CMake, and plain Makefile projects.
- **For fork support**: Run `scripts/run-wasm-fork-instrument.sh` as the final
  post-link step. Without complete `wpk_fork_*` exports, fork-using programs
  are invalid.
- **For DRM/KMS/EGL/GLES programs**: Rebuild the wasm32 sysroot with
  `scripts/dev-shell.sh bash scripts/build-musl.sh` if `libdrm`, `libgbm`,
  `libEGL`, or `libGLESv2` is missing. `build.sh` does not rebuild musl or
  these sysroot libraries.
- **Memory limit**: Default max memory is 1GB (16384 pages). Processes start with a smaller computed shared memory and grow on demand up to `maxMemoryPages`.
