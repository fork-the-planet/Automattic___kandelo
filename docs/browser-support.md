# Browser Support

> **Contributor note — dual-host parity is load-bearing.** The browser host is a peer of the Node.js host, not a follower. Any change touching host-runtime behavior MUST land symmetrically on both hosts, **in the same PR**. See [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#two-hosts-browser-and-nodejs--dual-host-parity-is-load-bearing) for the hard requirements. PR #388 (brk-base) and PR #410 (worker exit message) both shipped one-sided fixes that left browser behavior broken for users; those are the failure modes this rule exists to prevent.

## Overview

Kandelo runs in modern browsers with SharedArrayBuffer support (Chrome 91+, Firefox 79+, Safari 16.4+). The shared-kernel architecture uses one kernel Wasm instance in a dedicated web worker, with each process running in a sub-worker.

## Required HTTP Headers

SharedArrayBuffer requires cross-origin isolation:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Without these headers, `SharedArrayBuffer` is undefined and the kernel cannot initialize.

## Architecture

The kernel runs in a dedicated web worker, freeing the main thread for UI rendering and coordination only. The main thread uses `BrowserKernel` as a thin proxy that communicates with the kernel worker via `postMessage`.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Kernel in dedicated worker**: Browser syscall notification remains event-driven through `Atomics.waitAsync`; it does not poll channels. The browser config uses batch size 1 so every relisten and already-`PENDING` dispatch is deferred through the MessageChannel-backed `setImmediate` queue, allowing syscall handling and worker messages to keep progressing together under multi-process bridge load. Node.js keeps its native/default batching unchanged.
- **Kernel-owned VFS** (preferred path, `kernelOwnedFs: true` + `kernel.boot()`): the kernel worker restores a pre-built VFS image and exec()s `argv[0]` as the first process. The main thread never instantiates a `MemoryFileSystem` and is not in the FS hot path. Service-supervised demos run dinit (PID 1) inside this image; single-program demos exec the language interpreter directly.
  Browser harnesses that must stage a transient file between process spawns use
  `BrowserKernel`'s worker RPC methods (`readFileSnapshotFromVfs`,
  `writeFileToVfs`, and `unlinkFileFromVfs`). The owning worker performs those
  mutations through the mounted VFS; the main thread never receives the live
  VFS `SharedArrayBuffer`.
- **Legacy shared VFS** (`memfs:` constructor option + `kernel.spawn()`): main thread holds a `MemoryFileSystem` and shares the SAB with the kernel worker. Used by demos that fetch transient binaries at runtime (test runners, REPLs that load arbitrary user code, benchmark suites). Kept in place until the kernel grows a "spawn-into-running-kernel" path that doesn't need a main-thread pid.
- **Exec reads from filesystem**: Like a real OS, `exec()` reads binaries from the kernel-side `MemoryFileSystem`. Programs are baked into the VFS image at build time (or written by the page in the legacy path before spawning). Symlinks are used for multicall binaries (e.g., coreutils).
- **dinit (PID 1) for service supervision**: Multi-process demos (nginx, redis, mariadb, nginx-php, wordpress, lamp, mariadb-test) bake `/sbin/dinit` and per-service files under `/etc/dinit.d/` into the VFS image via `addDinitInit()` (`images/vfs/scripts/dinit-image-helpers.ts`). dinit handles SIGCHLD reaping, `depends-on` ordering, and bootstrap-then-daemon chains. Page code waits for service-ready via `onListenTcp` (port-bind) callbacks, then starts driving the demo over kernel-loopback TCP or the HTTP bridge.
- **Connection pump in kernel worker**: HTTP↔TCP bridge runs inside the kernel worker with synchronous pipe I/O (direct Wasm export calls). Service worker transfers a MessagePort to the kernel worker for HTTP request delivery.
- **App clients on main thread**: MySQL and Redis wire protocol clients stay on the main thread and use async pipe operations via the message protocol.
- **Rust-owned advisory locks**: the browser host does not hold advisory-lock
  records in a `SharedArrayBuffer` or inspect their ranges. The machine-wide
  Rust `ProcessTable` manager is authoritative. When a blocking `F_SETLKW`
  conflicts, the browser worker parks that syscall channel; a Rust advisory-lock
  wake event reschedules parked lock requests after unlock, conversion, close,
  or process teardown. `ENOLCK` completes immediately, and the short retry
  timer is only a scheduling safety net. Descriptors queued through
  `SCM_RIGHTS` retain their Rust `OfdId`, `FileId`, and backing reference, so
  sender close, successful receipt, discard, and receiver-allocation failure
  all use the same final-reference rule without host-side lock inspection.

### ABI 40 host-package migration

ABI 40 removes the kernel's `host_fcntl_lock` import and removes the public
`wasm-posix-host` exports `SharedLockTable` and `LockInfo`, along with
`WasmPosixKernel.registerSharedLockTable()`. This is an intentional breaking
host-package API change, not a deprecation shim. Embedders must stop importing,
constructing, registering, or crash-resetting a shared lock table. The guest
`fcntl`, OFD-lock, and `flock` APIs remain available; all lock state, ownership,
range operations, and the 4096-normalized-record policy now live in the kernel
Wasm.

The host `StatResult.dev` and `StatResult.ino` fields now accept
`number | bigint`, and Node-backed adapters return `bigint` so device and inode
identities cannot lose precision. Embedders that serialize these values or use
number-only arithmetic must handle `bigint` explicitly. The kernel marshalling
contract remains exact unsigned 64-bit values.

### Syscall Flow

```
Process Worker → SharedArrayBuffer channel → Atomics.notify
→ CentralizedKernelWorker.handleChannel() → kernel_handle_channel()
→ result written to channel → Atomics.notify → Process Worker resumes
```

### HTTP Request Flow (nginx/WordPress demos)

```
Browser fetch → Service Worker intercepts
→ MessagePort → BrowserKernel.fetchInKernel() → Kernel Worker
→ kernel_inject_connection() → pipe write (raw HTTP)
→ nginx (Wasm) accepts, processes → pipe read (response)
→ MessagePort → Service Worker → browser Response
```

Injected TCP pipes live in the kernel's global pipe table (`pid == 0` for
`kernel_pipe_*` host calls), so a listener inherited across fork can accept the
connection in any nginx worker. The standalone nginx image runs with
`master_process on` and `worker_processes 2`.

AF_UNIX stream listeners use the same shared-queue ownership model. This is the
path used by pre-fork PHP-FPM workers: a connection is queued once and whichever
worker wins `accept()` materializes its own connected socket around the global
pipe pair.

## Capabilities

### Multi-Process
- `fork()` via `wasm-fork-instrument` snapshot/restore — child runs in new sub-worker with copied memory
- `exec()` reads program binary from the shared filesystem, replaces process
- `posix_spawn()` — non-forking child creation with file actions (addchdir, addfchdir, addclose, adddup2)
- Process groups, wait/waitpid, cross-process signals, pipes

### Threads
- `clone()` with `CLONE_VM|CLONE_THREAD` — shared Memory between parent and thread Workers
- Used by MariaDB (5 threads), Redis (3 background threads)

### Networking
- POSIX AF_INET TCP and UDP inside the kernel, including local loopback and virtual IPv4 machine-to-machine networking
- Partial AF_INET6 streams and datagrams for `::`/`::1`; loopback streams have a cross-process path, while datagrams remain process-local, and neither provides external or virtual-network IPv6
- In-kernel IPv4/IPv6 loopback datagrams, AF_UNIX datagrams, and IPv4 multicast are process-local; machine-wide datagram routing is still pending
- `LocalVirtualNetwork` attaches multiple browser Kandelo machines to virtual IPv4 addresses in one browser session
- Browser networking backends preserve valid decimal one-, two-, three-, and four-component IPv4 forms, reject malformed/overflowing numeric forms, enforce ASCII host-label syntax and DNS length limits, and synthesize IPv4 addresses only for acceptable hostnames; they do not provide AF_INET6 DNS/transport
- GNU Netcat (`nc`) and `curl` run against those virtual sockets in the network lab at `/pages/network/`
- Service worker cookie jar for session persistence (WordPress)
- nginx serves static files and proxies to PHP-FPM via loopback TCP

### Filesystem
- `MemoryFileSystem` — SharedArrayBuffer-based VFS shared between main thread and kernel worker
- `OpfsFileSystem` — Origin Private File System for browser persistence. Its
  worker assigns session-scoped inode tokens to regular files and uses
  `FileSystemHandle.isSameEntry()` to unify simultaneous opens. Tokens remain
  stable for live handles across supported rename and unlink; unlink followed
  by recreation is a different identity. Device and inode cross the OPFS
  channel as exact unsigned 64-bit integers. A browser that lacks the required
  identity or move primitive reports the unsupported boundary rather than
  substituting a pathname identity. The OPFS proxy owns namespace mutation for
  its origin during a session and sweeps its hidden unlink-while-open orphan
  directory at startup; running multiple independent proxy workers against the
  same origin concurrently is not a supported coherence model. Regular-file
  `fsync()` calls the browser's file-handle `flush()` operation. Directory
  `fsync()` succeeds after already-completed directory operations because the
  File System API exposes no directory flush primitive; it is not an
  additional crash-durability barrier.
- `DeviceFileSystem` — `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, `/dev/urandom`, `/dev/ptmx`
- Stable-identity regular files, including OPFS regular files on supported
  browsers, can be shared across process memories through the host mapping
  cache, but updates become visible at syscall boundaries rather than
  immediately on direct loads/stores. Cross-process futex waits/wakes remain
  unsupported; see [architecture.md](architecture.md#shared-mapping-coherence).
- Advisory locking uses `host_fstat` on the live open handle and the same
  backend-qualified identity. If a filesystem backend cannot provide a stable,
  exact identity, locking fails truthfully with `ENOLCK`; it never falls back
  to hashing the remembered path.

### Terminal
- PTY support with full line discipline
- Interactive stdin via `appendStdinData` for incremental input
- xterm.js integration via `PtyTerminal`

### Framebuffer (`/dev/fb0`)
- 640×400 BGRA32 packed-pixel framebuffer; exclusive process owner.
- The pixel buffer lives in the process's `WebAssembly.Memory` (a `SharedArrayBuffer`); the kernel notifies the host of `(pid, addr, len, w, h, stride, fmt)` on `mmap`, and the host renders via `requestAnimationFrame` + a 2D-canvas `putImageData` per frame.
- `host/src/framebuffer/canvas-renderer.ts::attachCanvas(canvas, registry, pid, opts)` is the consumer-side renderer.
- Keyboard input: the demo page maps focused browser `KeyboardEvent` values to Linux input keycodes, encodes them as MEDIUMRAW bytes, and feeds them through `appendStdinData(pid, …)`; fbDOOM-style software decodes those bytes from the tty. Ctrl+Shift+Esc is reserved as the host escape from keyboard capture.
- Limitations: `fork` does not auto-bind the child; multi-buffering / vsync via `FBIOPAN_DISPLAY` is a no-op.

### Mouse input (`/dev/input/mice`)
- Demo pages attach `mousemove` / `mousedown` / `mouseup` listeners to the canvas and call `BrowserKernel.injectMouseEvent(dx, dy, buttons)`. The main thread posts a `mouse_inject` message to the kernel worker, which calls the kernel's `kernel_inject_mouse_event` export. The kernel encodes a 3-byte PS/2 frame and queues it on a global ring; user processes drain the queue via `read("/dev/input/mice", …)`.
- **Pointer Lock recommended.** The DOOM demo calls `canvas.requestPointerLock()` on first click so the browser delivers unbounded relative motion (`MouseEvent.movementX/Y`). Without pointer lock, `clientX/Y` deltas clamp at the canvas edges and feel sluggish for first-person controls. Press `Esc` to release the lock.
- Browser `deltaY` is positive-down; the demo inverts it before injection so the kernel queue holds canonical PS/2 (positive-up) deltas.
- Browser `MouseEvent.button` (0=L, 1=M, 2=R) is mapped to PS/2 button bits (bit0=L, bit1=R, bit2=M). Right-click suppresses the browser context menu via `contextmenu` `preventDefault()`.
- Single-owner device (one process can hold `/dev/input/mice` open at a time; second open from another pid returns `EBUSY`).

### Audio output (`/dev/dsp`)
- The kernel exposes an OSS-style `/dev/dsp` character device. User programs `open(O_WRONLY)`, configure rate / channels / format via `SNDCTL_DSP_*` ioctls, and `write()` interleaved 16-bit-LE PCM. The kernel buffers samples in a 256 KiB ring (~1.5 s of stereo S16 @ 44.1 kHz). On overflow the *oldest* whole frame drops — same trade-off real OSS hardware makes under hardware overrun.
- Demo pages drive a `setInterval` loop (~50 ms cadence) that calls `BrowserKernel.drainAudio(maxBytes)`. The kernel-worker drains the ring via the `kernel_drain_audio` wasm export (which respects whole-frame boundaries so stereo L/R never tear) and posts the bytes back. Main thread converts S16 → Float32, builds an `AudioBuffer`, and schedules an `AudioBufferSourceNode` on the `AudioContext` clock with a small lookahead so brief drain hiccups don't underrun.
- Single-owner device. A non-CLOEXEC fd retains ownership and queued samples across `execve`; last close or process exit releases the owner and flushes the ring so a successor starts from silence. Format must be `AFMT_S16_LE`; other formats are `EINVAL`.
- **AudioContext gesture requirement.** `new AudioContext()` starts suspended in modern browsers and only resumes after a user gesture. The DOOM demo creates the context immediately after the user's "Start" click (which is itself a gesture), so `audioCtx.resume()` succeeds without a separate prompt.

| doom | fbDOOM | legacy spawn | `/dev/fb0` framebuffer + canvas renderer + keyboard via stdin + mouse via `/dev/input/mice` (pointer-locked) + SFX **and** OPL2-synthesized music via `/dev/dsp` → AudioContext. The shareware `doom1.wad` is **fetched at page load** from a Linux-distro mirror (SHA-256 verified, Cache API cached); no IWAD ships in the package archive. |

The "Boot pattern" column reflects how the demo enters the kernel:
- **`kernel.boot`** — `kernelOwnedFs: true`, exec the language interpreter as the first process.
- **dinit** — `kernelOwnedFs: true`, exec dinit (PID 1), which brings up the per-demo service tree.
- **dinit + spawn** — dinit boots the supervised services; the page spawns transient binaries (e.g. mysqltest) via `kernel.spawn()`.
- **legacy spawn** — main thread restores a `MemoryFileSystem`, page calls `kernel.spawn(programBytes, argv)` for each binary.

Run the browser app: `cd apps/browser-demos && npm run dev`, then open
`http://127.0.0.1:5401/`.

### Kandelo session UI

The Kandelo app at `/pages/kandelo/` keeps the running machine as the primary
browser canvas and exposes related tools through a bottom dock. Dock controls
switch between Demo, Terminal, and Internals views, while dock panes open for
new-machine setup, gallery browsing, system config, and sharing. These controls
consume `KernelHost` state and actions rather than replacing the runtime path.

The dock may be collapsed or moved horizontally within the browser viewport;
that placement is UI-only presentation state and does not alter the running
machine, boot descriptor, VFS image, or share/export data.

Image-declared demo guides from `/etc/kandelo/demo.json` remain part of the
machine presentation owned by the demo image. Guide actions may run terminal or
web actions through `KernelHost`, but they do not replace process supervision,
VFS state, networking, or runtime behavior.

Cross-origin browser fetches are routed through `public/service-worker.js`,
which defaults to `https://wordpress-playground-cors-proxy.net/?`. Override it
with `VITE_CORS_PROXY_URL` when testing another proxy:

```bash
cd apps/browser-demos
VITE_CORS_PROXY_URL='https://your-proxy.example/?' npm run dev
```

Proxy prefixes ending in a bare `?` receive raw target URLs; `?url=`-style
prefixes receive percent-encoded targets.

### Blob-URL iframes (service-worker boundary)

The service worker can only bridge requests from documents it **controls**. A
`blob:` document is not service-worker-controlled (and has no base URL), so its
subresource requests bypass the bridge and hit the static origin instead of the
in-kernel server. This is a real browser boundary, not a Kandelo bug.

It surfaces in the WordPress block/site editor, whose canvas iframe is mounted
from `URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([html]))`: the canvas's
`load-scripts.php`/`load-styles.php` and block-asset requests would 404 against
the origin even though nginx serves them correctly over the bridge.

`public/blob-iframe-interceptor.js` is a reusable, framework-free DOM patch that
neutralizes this class of issue. It hooks `Blob`/`URL.createObjectURL` and the
`HTMLIFrameElement` `src` setter/`setAttribute` so that any iframe pointed at a
`text/html` blob URL is instead rendered from `srcdoc` (an `about:srcdoc`
document, which the service worker *does* control). It is idempotent and a no-op
unless a text/html blob URL is used as an iframe src. The service worker inlines
it (via the `"__BLOB_IFRAME_INTERCEPTOR__"` build-time placeholder, mirroring
`"__CORS_PROXY_URL__"`) into the `<head>` of every bridged HTML document, so it
applies to all app demos, not just WordPress.

## VFS Images

Browser demos use pre-built **VFS images** — binary snapshots of a `MemoryFileSystem` containing all runtime files, directory structure, configs, and symlinks needed by a demo. At runtime, restoring a VFS image is a single buffer copy, replacing what would otherwise be hundreds or thousands of individual file creation operations.

### How it works

1. **Build time**: A TypeScript build script creates a `MemoryFileSystem`, writes files/dirs/symlinks into it, and calls `saveImage()` to produce a zstd-compressed `.vfs.zst` file. Empty regions of the SharedFS allocator compress to nearly nothing, so a 32 MB filesystem with a few MB of real content typically ships as a 1–3 MB download. If the image should grow or report a larger `df` capacity at runtime, build it with `MemoryFileSystem.create(sab, permittedMaxBytes)` so the filesystem metadata is sized for that capacity.
2. **Runtime**: The demo page fetches the `.vfs.zst` file, calls `MemoryFileSystem.fromImage(imageBytes, { maxByteLength })` (which auto-detects zstd magic and decompresses transparently), and passes the resulting filesystem to `BrowserKernel({ memfs })`. `maxByteLength` makes the restored `SharedArrayBuffer` growable; it does not raise the filesystem maximum beyond the image's superblock limit.

```typescript
// Typical demo pattern
const [kernelBuf, vfsImageBuf] = await Promise.all([
  fetch(kernelUrl).then(r => r.arrayBuffer()),
  fetch(vfsImageUrl).then(r => r.arrayBuffer()),
]);

const memfs = MemoryFileSystem.fromImage(
  new Uint8Array(vfsImageBuf),
  { maxByteLength: 512 * 1024 * 1024 },
);

const kernel = await BrowserKernel.create({ kernelWasm: kernelBuf, memfs });
```

### Kandelo demo metadata

VFS images can also carry UI presentation metadata at `/etc/kandelo/demo.json`.
The Kandelo live loader reads this file immediately after restoring the image,
before kernel instantiation, and uses it to decide which surface should be
primary during boot and after the demo is ready. This keeps demo-specific UI
preferences with the image instead of hardcoding them in the page loader.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "profiles": {
    "wordpress-sqlite": {
      "presentation": {
        "bootPrimary": "syslog",
        "runningPrimary": ["web", "terminal", "syslog"],
        "terminalAccess": "drawer",
        "internalsAccess": "drawer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use `writeKandeloDemoConfig()` from
`images/vfs/scripts/kandelo-demo-config.ts` in VFS build scripts. Images
without this file still boot with Kandelo's generic presentation defaults, but
the Kandelo app does not carry demo-specific presentation fallbacks.
Any extra files needed by an image-declared `autoCommand` can be declared in
`assets`; the loader stages those paths generically and hash-verifies them when
`sha256` is provided.

KMS demos use the same metadata path. A profile can set
`runningPrimary` to include `"kms"` and provide an `autoCommand` such as
`/usr/local/bin/modeset`; the VFS image must contain that executable. The
Kandelo app attaches the KMS canvas through the generic KMS surface plumbing,
then runs the image-declared command. Do not add browser-loader branches that
import or spawn a specific `modeset.wasm` file.

Images can also declare an optional `guide`. When `guide` is absent, Kandelo
does not render a demo panel; this is the intended shape for demos where the
primary surface is enough, such as WordPress and Doom. A guide can contain
button groups, an editable shell script, and optional companion HTML:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "profiles": {
    "node": {
      "guide": {
        "title": "Node.js demo",
        "groups": [{
          "title": "REPL",
          "actions": [
            {
              "id": "enter-repl",
              "label": "Open REPL",
              "kind": "terminal.run",
              "payload": "node"
            },
            {
              "id": "send-expression",
              "label": "Send expr",
              "kind": "terminal.write",
              "payload": "process.version\n"
            }
          ]
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`terminal.run` sends a command through the persistent PTY-backed shell.
`terminal.write` sends raw text to that PTY, which is useful for entering input
into an already-running REPL. `guide.companion.srcDoc` runs in a sandboxed
iframe and has no direct kernel access; it can only request parent-approved
actions by posting `{ type: "kandelo.demoAction", actionId }`.

When changing metadata for an existing package-backed image, bump that
package's `build.toml` `revision` so published/fetched binaries are rebuilt.
For local browser artifacts, force a rebuild with `./run.sh rebuild <target>`.

### VFS images per demo

| Demo | Image | Build command | What's inside |
|------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Python | `python.vfs.zst` | `bash images/vfs/scripts/build-python-vfs-image.sh` | CPython stdlib |
| Erlang | `erlang.vfs.zst` | `bash images/vfs/scripts/build-erlang-vfs-image.sh` | OTP runtime |
| Perl | `perl.vfs.zst` | `bash images/vfs/scripts/build-perl-vfs-image.sh` | Perl stdlib |
| Shell | `shell.vfs.zst` | `bash images/vfs/scripts/build-shell-vfs-image.sh` | dash, symlinks, vim runtime |
| Node | `node-vfs.vfs.zst` | `bash images/vfs/scripts/build-node-vfs-image.sh` | npm 10.9.2 dist + writable `/work` |
| WordPress | `wordpress.vfs.zst` | `bash images/vfs/scripts/build-wp-vfs-image.sh` | WP files, nginx/PHP configs |
| LAMP | `lamp.vfs.zst` | `bash images/vfs/scripts/build-lamp-vfs-image.sh` | MariaDB + WP + configs |
| MariaDB test | `mariadb-test.vfs.zst` | `bash images/vfs/scripts/build-mariadb-test-vfs-image.sh` | MariaDB + test suite |

The standalone MariaDB demo and MariaDB test images run `mariadbd` as the
`mysql` account (uid/gid 101). Their writable `/data` directories are
therefore serialized as `101:101` with mode `0775`; `/tmp` remains a
root-owned `01777` sticky directory.

VFS images are `.gitignore`d and must be built locally. The `run.sh` script handles this automatically (e.g., `./run.sh browser` builds any missing VFS images before starting the dev server).

Homebrew-derived browser images are published through the package-source
gallery path, not bundled into the app. The trusted Homebrew publisher first
pours a wasm32 bottle into a precomposed `.vfs.zst`, boots that image in the
browser UI, and runs the package smoke command, such as
`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/hello --version`. Only then may the generated
Homebrew sidecars and gallery `index.toml` set `browser_compatible = true`.

A Homebrew gallery entry is visible only when its `index.toml` package record
is wasm32 success, has an `archive_url`, and sets
`browser_compatible = true`. Launch-time archive failures are surfaced in the
UI instead of silently hiding the rest of the gallery.

### Building VFS images

Each build script requires the corresponding software to be compiled first (e.g., `build-cpython.sh` before `build-python-vfs-image.sh`). The `run.sh` script orchestrates this:

```bash
./run.sh build python-vfs    # Build Python VFS image
./run.sh build shell-vfs     # Build Shell VFS image
./run.sh build all            # Build everything including all VFS images

### Adding a new VFS image

1. Create `images/vfs/scripts/build-<name>-vfs-image.ts` — import helpers from `vfs-image-helpers.ts`
2. Create `images/vfs/scripts/build-<name>-vfs-image.sh` — shell wrapper that runs the TypeScript script
3. If the image is consumed by Kandelo, write `/etc/kandelo/demo.json` via `writeKandeloDemoConfig()`
4. If the image is consumed by the Kandelo UI, expose it through a gallery manifest, preset, or direct `vfs` URL so the UI can fetch the `.vfs.zst` image and use `MemoryFileSystem.fromImage()` (which auto-decompresses)
5. Add a build target in `run.sh`

The shared helpers in `vfs-image-helpers.ts` provide:
- `writeVfsFile(fs, path, content)` / `writeVfsBinary(fs, path, data)` — write files
- `ensureDirRecursive(fs, path)` — create directory trees
- `symlink(fs, target, path)` — create symlinks
- `walkAndWrite(fs, hostDir, mountPrefix, opts?)` — recursively walk a host directory into the VFS
- `saveImage(fs, outFile)` — save and write the image to disk

## Vite Configuration

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default {
  server: {
    headers: {
      "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin",
      "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp",
    },
  },
};
```

## Known Limitations

### SharedArrayBuffer restrictions
Chrome rejects SharedArrayBuffer-backed views in `TextDecoder.decode()` and `crypto.getRandomValues()`. Always copy to a temporary non-shared buffer first.

### No external raw sockets
Browser sandboxing prevents Kandelo from listening on real network ports or opening raw TCP/UDP sockets to arbitrary external peers. Local loopback sockets and `LocalVirtualNetwork` listeners are virtual sockets inside the browser session, so Kandelo machines can still communicate with each other using POSIX UDP/TCP. Browser-facing HTTP server demos use a service worker to intercept HTTP requests and inject them as kernel TCP connections via the connection pump.

### Memory per process
Each process gets `WebAssembly.Memory(shared: true, initial: layout.initialPages, max: maxPages)`. The initial size covers the program's imported minimum memory, a brk window, and the low syscall control channel; it no longer allocates `maxPages` at spawn. `maxMemoryPages` still caps guest brk/mmap growth and should be tuned for workloads that need large address spaces.

### npm registry access in the browser
The node demo's `npm install` uses `--registry=http://proxy.local/` so registry traffic can pass through the host fetch bridge instead of requiring the JavaScript runtime to own every TLS edge case. The kernel resolves `proxy.local` via `host_getaddrinfo` (it is deliberately absent from the synthetic `/etc/hosts`), and the host-side TLS backend re-routes those requests through the existing cors-proxy (dev) or service worker (prod) onto `https://registry.npmjs.org/`. Tarball URLs in JSON responses are rewritten to the same alias so subsequent fetches stay on the same path.
