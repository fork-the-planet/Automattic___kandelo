# Core Software Test Suites on Kandelo

This project proves Kandelo by running real upstream/project test suites for
large guest software on both Node.js and browser hosts where possible.

Status date: 2026-06-16.

## Historical Status Snapshot

| Project | What is wired today | Node host status | Browser host status |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| MariaDB | `mysql-test/main/*.test` through `mysqltest` against `mariadbd` | Started full run, stopped after 710 results due Node heap OOM | Browser run reached the harness but failed VFS/init fetch and recorded 1149 failures |
| SQLite direct | Direct execution of each upstream Tcl `test/*.test` script once through `testfixture` | Completed 1159 scripts: 912 PASS, 36 FAIL, 15 XFAIL, 196 XPASS | Completed 1159 scripts: 876 PASS, 62 FAIL, 38 XFAIL, 173 XPASS, 10 TIME |
| SQLite official | Upstream `test/testrunner.tcl` permutations `full` and `all` | Completed corrected Node `full --jobs 2`: 1416/1416 official Tcl jobs finalized, 1416 passed, 0 failed, 1,703,255 SQLite internal cases, 0 case errors. The prior `busy2.test` failure was fixed by rebuilding the SQLite artifacts with `SQLITE_ENABLE_SETLK_TIMEOUT=2`, matching SQLite's own official lock-timeout test configuration; see `docs/sqlite-official-test-report.md` | Same inventory: 1416 `full` jobs and 10523 `all` jobs. Current browser iteration is past the earlier `writecrash.test` blocker and reached a timeout/stall checkpoint at 40/1416 jobs, 12,206 cases, 0 case errors, with `test/sort4.test` still running. Node isolated `sort4.test` passes 11/11 in 54s; browser isolated `sort4.test` was still at 0/1 after about 3 minutes before maintenance stop. See `docs/sqlite-official-test-report.md`. |
| PHP | PHPT runtime tests from the PHP source tree | Full discovered Node PHPT set completed on PR #2: 19,017/19,017 covered, 14,554 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 TIMEOUT, 9 XFAIL, 1 XPASS, 3,987 SKIP, 466 UNSUPPORTED. | Browser harness is wired through the `php-test` Vite page and VFS image; current PR #2 browser coverage is still partial: 2,363/19,017 covered, 2,141 PASS, 2 FAIL, 1 XFAIL, 212 SKIP, 7 UNSUPPORTED. |

## 2026-06-16 PHP PHPT Node Source-PR Full Run

php-src discovery finds **19,017** `.phpt` files from PHP **8.3.15**. The
source-PR Node run completed the full discovered set. The aggregate
uses chronological chunk results plus targeted reruns for tests whose earlier
results were invalidated by harness or external-service issues:

| Host | Scope | Pass | XFAIL | XPASS | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Unsupported | Untested | Total |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Node | Chunked `--all`, historical source-PR head `bc13ad8631a2` | 14,554 | 9 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3,987 | 466 | 0 | 19,017 |

The bounded final segment used the restartable chunk harness. The chunk wrapper defaults to `--host node` and can also checkpoint browser runs with `--host browser`. Browser runs fingerprint the PHP source, binaries, extensions, rootfs, and VFS builder inputs and rebuild the image when they change; `--rebuild-vfs` remains an explicit force-rebuild option. The VFS builder honors an explicit `PHP_OPCACHE_SO` by writing it to `/usr/lib/php/extensions/opcache.so` after scanning `PHP_EXTENSION_DIR`, so a stale directory entry cannot override the requested OPcache side module:

```bash
TEST_NON_ROOT_USER=nobody \
TEST_FPM_RUN_AS_ROOT=1 \
PHP_TEST_FAILURE_SNIPPET_BYTES=5000 \
PHP_WASM=/tmp/kad-php-dynfork.wasm \
PHP_FPM_WASM="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin/php-fpm.wasm" \
PHP_OPCACHE_SO=/tmp/kad-opcache-sidefork.so \
PHP_EXTENSION_DIR="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin" \
PHP_TEST_CHUNK_SIZE=500 \
PHP_TEST_JOBS=2 \
PHP_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS=240000 \
PHP_TEST_HOST_RESET_INTERVAL=1 \
scripts/run-php-upstream-node-chunks.sh \
  --host node \
  --start-offset 8962 \
  --out-dir /tmp/kad-1-test-logs/php-node-bounded-chunks-from-8962-20260616075451 \
  --chunk-size 500 --jobs 2 --timeout 240000 --host-reset-interval 1
```

Important reruns included:

- `Zend/tests/generators/bug71441.phpt`, which now passes after increasing the
  default Node host worker stack from 16 MiB to 32 MiB. This is a general host
  stability change for deep guest stacks, not PHP-specific behavior.
- FPM non-root/virtual-ownership coverage, which now passes after allowing
  host-backed mounts to expose stable virtual uid/gid metadata to the guest.
- Two online `httpbin.org` HTTP/1.1 PHPTs, which are now counted as upstream
  skips under `SKIP_ONLINE_TESTS=1` after host `curl --http1.1` confirmed
  `httpbin.org` currently returns HTTP/1.1 503. This is an external service
  availability issue, not a Kandelo kernel failure.

The only XPASS is
`sapi/fpm/tests/log-bwd-multiple-msgs-stdout-stderr.phpt`, an upstream
intermittent XFAIL that passed locally.

Current skip/unsupported coverage gaps should be reduced through normal
runtime packaging and harness support:

- Missing optional PHP extensions/dependencies: `intl`, `oci8`, `gd`, `curl`,
  `ldap`, `ffi`, `gmp`, `imap`, `zip`, `pgsql`, and related extension suites.
- External services: MySQL/PDO MySQL connection tests require a running
  compatible database service; the two `httpbin.org` online tests are skipped
  while HTTP/1.1 requests to that service return 503.
- FPM/CGI/web PHPTs: the Node harness can now stage `php-fpm` when
  `PHP_FPM_WASM` is set, and passes upstream's `TEST_FPM_RUN_AS_ROOT` control
  env through to guest tests. This exposes real FPM coverage instead of
  treating every FPM helper test as a CLI test:

  ```bash
  TEST_FPM_RUN_AS_ROOT=1 \
  PHP_WASM="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin/php.wasm" \
  PHP_FPM_WASM="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin/php-fpm.wasm" \
  PHP_OPCACHE_SO=/tmp/kad-opcache-sidefork.so \
  scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --json \
    sapi/fpm/tests/<test>.phpt
  ```

- web/CGI PHPT sections such as `EXPECTHEADERS`, `POST`, `POST_RAW`, `GET`,
  `COOKIE`, `CGI`, `GZIP_POST`, `DEFLATE_POST`, and `REDIRECTTEST` still need
  general harness support.
- Fibers require a real general `getcontext`/`makecontext`/`swapcontext`
  implementation or another Wasm context-switching backend.
- phpdbg PHPTs require building and packaging the phpdbg SAPI.
- DNS record-query PHPTs require enabling a correct resolver backend in the
  PHP build/runtime.


## 2026-06-14 PHP PHPT Node Chunked Full Run

php-src discovery still finds **19,017** `.phpt` files from PHP **8.3.15**.
The current no-skip-env Node run is using the restartable chunk harness added in
this PR update:

```bash
PHP_WASM="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin/php.wasm" \
PHP_OPCACHE_SO="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin/opcache.so" \
  scripts/run-php-upstream-node-chunks.sh \
  --chunk-size 500 --jobs 4 --timeout 600000 \
  --host-reset-interval 25 \
  --out-dir /tmp/kad-1-test-logs/php-node-chunks-20260614225117
```

This wrapper runs the same reusable PHPT harness in fresh Node.js processes per
chunk and writes resumable `chunk-<offset>.jsonl`, `.stderr`, `.exit`, `.done`,
`summary.json`, and `summary.md` artifacts. It avoids the previous monolithic
Node run shape, which reached **1,275 results** (**1,265 pass**, **10 skip**)
but grew to about **7.3 GiB RSS** and was killed before completion.

Latest observed partial no-skip-env Node counts while the chunked run continues:

| Host | Scope | Pass | XFAIL | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Unsupported | Untested | Total |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Node | Chunked `--all`, offsets 0..current partial chunk | 1,519 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 18 | 0 | 17,479 | 19,017 |

Current failing test observed in the partial run:

- `Zend/tests/concat_003.phpt`: pure PHP performance threshold check. The test
  expects concatenating a large set of strings to finish below the upstream
  native-runtime threshold of 1.0 second; the Wasm PHP runtime currently reports
  `bool(false)`. This is not yet tied to a POSIX/kernel semantic failure and
  should not be papered over with PHP-specific kernel behavior.

Current skips observed in the partial run are upstream `SKIPIF` gates for
64-bit-only Zend tests, Zend MM, and missing optional extensions (`curl`,
`intl`). These remain coverage gaps to reduce through general PHP runtime
packaging/host support, not through Kandelo kernel special cases.

New general platform fix in this update:

- AF_INET6 loopback stream listeners are registered through the same
  cross-process host TCP bridge used for AF_INET loopback while preserving guest
  IPv6 socket metadata. This lets a child process listen on `::1` and a sibling
  process connect to `::1`, matching normal loopback behavior. Targeted Node
  verification now passes:

```bash
PHP_WASM="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin/php.wasm" \
PHP_OPCACHE_SO="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin/opcache.so" \
  scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --timeout 180000 --json \
  ext/openssl/tests/san_ipv6_peer_matching.phpt
# => PASS
```

Additional local validation for this update:

- `cargo test -p kandelo inet6_loopback --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` — 3 pass
- `bash packages/registry/kernel/build-kernel.sh` — rebuilt and installed `local-binaries/kernel.wasm` / `host/wasm/kandelo-kernel.wasm`

## 2026-06-12 PHP PHPT Node Iteration

php-src discovery currently finds **19,017** `.phpt` files from PHP **8.3.15**.

Current no-skip-env Node full run command:

```bash
PHP_WASM="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin/php.wasm" \
PHP_OPCACHE_SO="$PWD/packages/registry/php/bin/opcache.so" \
  scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --all --jobs 4 \
  --timeout 600000 --host-reset-interval 25 --json
```

The active log is recorded in `/tmp/kad-1-current-node-full-log`.

Changes since the 2026-06-11 handoff:

- The PHPT harness now has `--host-reset-interval` for Node. This reboots each
  runner's Kandelo kernel after a bounded number of PHPTs, reclaiming
  host-side WebAssembly memory the same way native `make test` gets OS process
  reclamation between PHP invocations. `0` disables the reset.
- The PHP package now builds and ships `zend_test.so` as an opt-in shared
  extension. Upstream php-src uses `zend_test` for engine coverage; making it a
  normal loadable module removes those skips without loading test-only code by
  default or special-casing the harness.
- PHP configure now passes `--disable-rpath`; wasm-ld does not support ELF
  runtime library search path flags, and the Wasm PHP package links static
  dependency archives and explicit side modules instead.
- Targeted Node checks after the rebuild:
  - `Zend/tests/attributes/016_custom_attribute_validation.phpt`: PASS
  - `Zend/tests/bug74093.phpt`: PASS, validating POSIX timer delivery for Zend
    max-execution timers.
  - `Zend/tests/new_oom.phpt`: PASS with `--timeout 600000`; it takes about
    177 seconds on this AO worker and can false-timeout under the older 180s
    full-run timeout.
  - The previous opcache/OpenSSL targeted failure set remains PASS.
  - `Zend/tests/concat_003.phpt`: still FAIL. The measured timed section takes
    about 4.3 seconds on the Wasm PHP runtime versus the upstream native
    performance threshold of 1.0 second. This is not currently attributable to
    a POSIX/kernel semantic failure.


## 2026-06-11 PHP PHPT Handoff Status

php-src discovery currently finds **19,017** `.phpt` files from PHP **8.3.15**.

Latest full/partial run evidence from this AO worker:

| Host | Run | Pass | Fail | Time | Skip | Unsupported | XFAIL | Untested | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Node | `SKIP_SLOW_TESTS=1 SKIP_ONLINE_TESTS=1 SKIP_PERF_SENSITIVE=1 scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --all --jobs 6 --timeout 120000 --json` | 12,589 | 71 | 7 | 5,880 | 462 | 8 | 0 | Complete pre-isolation baseline in `/tmp/kad-1-test-logs/php-node-full-current-detached-20260611062754.jsonl`. Some failures were false negatives from parallel workers sharing one writable `/php-src`. |
| Node | Same command after per-worker source-root isolation | 8,532 | 29 | 6 | 4,714 | 272 | 6 | 5,458 | Run was killed by the worker with exit 137 at 13,559/19,017 in `/tmp/kad-1-test-logs/php-node-full-isolated-current-20260611103236.jsonl`; rerun is required. |
| Browser | Four concurrent shards, Nix Chromium, partial | 1,172 | 17 | 0 | 17 | 0 | 0 | 17,811 | Partial logs under `/tmp/kad-1-test-logs/php-browser-shards4-current/`; the run was stopped before completion to continue Node/kernel iteration. |

Important interpretation of the Node skip count: the 5,880 skips are upstream
PHPT `SKIPIF` decisions, not harness failures. The largest groups are missing
optional PHP extensions/services in this build or environment: `soap` (552),
`intl` (524), `opcache` (500 in the old run), MySQL connection refused (391),
`oci8` (330), `gd` (292), `zend_test` (162), PDO MySQL connection refused
(145), `curl` (142), 64-bit-only tests (140), Windows-only tests (124), and
FPM/root guards (123).

The `opcache` skips in the complete Node baseline were a harness configuration
gap. Kandelo ships opcache as the separate Zend extension side module
`opcache.so`; it is not statically loaded into `php.wasm`. The harness now loads
known available shared extensions requested by `--EXTENSIONS--` with the proper
`zend_extension=` directive, recognizes PHP's loaded extension name
`Zend OPcache` as satisfying `opcache`, and writes `opcache.so` into the browser
PHPT VFS image. Targeted verification after this fix:

```bash
SKIP_SLOW_TESTS=1 SKIP_ONLINE_TESTS=1 SKIP_PERF_SENSITIVE=1 \
  scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --timeout 60000 --json \
  ext/opcache/tests/bool_cp_in_pass1.phpt
# => PASS
```

Kernel/host fixes present in that historical source-PR handoff:

- POSIX wait status encoding now distinguishes normal exits from signal deaths.
  Normal `_exit(status)` is masked to 8 bits and reported to `waitpid(2)` as
  `(status & 0xff) << 8`; signal termination records a separate signal number
  and reports the low 7-bit signal status. Host-side process scans still expose
  shell-style `128 + signal` where that API expects it.
- Hosts can mark captured stdio descriptors as pipes. The descriptor keeps its
  host stdio handle for I/O, but `fstat(2)` reports FIFO metadata and
  `isatty(3)` observes non-terminal behavior. This is needed for PHPT
  `--CAPTURE_STDIO--` cases and is a general POSIX metadata correction.
- Centralized `fork(2)` retries host PID allocation when the kernel still owns a
  zombie/limbo PID. The kernel remains the source of truth for PID occupancy;
  `fork(2)` callers should not observe an internal `EEXIST` collision.
- Thread exit now clears `CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID` storage and wakes the futex wait
  word, matching Linux pthread join expectations.
- Centralized host/kernel calls that pass guest pointers now route through the
  host pointer-width helper instead of hard-coded `BigInt` arguments.

PHP harness fixes present in that historical source-PR handoff:

- Node `--jobs N` uses one copied php-src tree per worker, avoiding cross-test
  contamination from generated `.php`/`.clean.php` files and tests that mutate
  source-adjacent fixtures. Targeted rerun of failures caused by shared source
  state passed 7/7 after this change.
- Node runner reuses a host for throughput but resets it after section timeouts;
  timeout handling no longer leaves the worker stuck for later PHPTs.
- Combined stdout/stderr ordering is captured from host callbacks so PHPT
  expectations that intentionally interleave warnings and output compare
  correctly.
- PHPT placeholder handling now includes `{TMP}`, `{MAIL:...}`, and `{ENV:...}`
  in addition to `{PWD}`.
- `TEST_PHP_EXTRA_ARGS` is kept empty, matching upstream use as extra switches
  rather than an executable path.
- Browser PHPT runs can use `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH`; on this AO
  runner a Nix Chromium binary was used because Playwright's downloaded browser
  lacked system shared libraries.

Local checks run before this handoff commit:

- `git diff --check`
- `npm --prefix host run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix host test -- --run test/multi-worker.test.ts test/select-timeout-retry.test.ts` — 12 pass
- `cargo test -p kandelo --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu poll_waitable_child --lib` — 5 pass

## 2026-06-05 PHP PHPT Harness Notes

The PHP PHPT harness is `scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh`. It runs the
upstream `php-src` `.phpt` inventory against Kandelo without calling native
`run-tests.php` directly: each `--EXTENSIONS--`, `--SKIPIF--`, `--FILE--`,
and `--CLEAN--` section is executed as a PHP process inside Kandelo, then the
harness applies the PHPT expectation match.

Current defaults use the PHP package source metadata, which now matches the
PHP binary built by `packages/registry/php/build-php.sh` (PHP 8.3.15). The
node host mounts the source tree at `/php-src`, mounts the PHP binary
directory at `/kandelo-bin`, and runs tests from `/php-src` to match upstream
`run-tests.php` working-directory semantics. The browser host uses the
`php-test` Vite page and `apps/browser-demos/public/php-test.vfs.zst`. The
harness fingerprints the inputs and rebuilds a stale image automatically;
`--rebuild-vfs` forces a rebuild when diagnosing the builder itself.

```

The browser VFS builder layers PHP and the PHPT source tree onto the canonical
`rootfs.vfs`, so shell and utility coverage comes from the same packaged rootfs
used by other Kandelo hosts. Set `ROOTFS_VFS` or `PHP_WASM` only when testing an
explicit alternate artifact. The browser page rewrites the rootfs's relative
lazy executable URLs to Vite-managed assets before the legacy shared-filesystem
runner registers them with the kernel worker.

Historical kernel/POSIX fixes found by the pre-split PHPT effort (not all are
part of PR #740 or its current landing branch):

- Pathname resolution must be component-wise. Kandelo no longer collapses
  `missing/..` lexically before the backend can report `ENOENT`.
- A trailing slash is significant: it requires the preceding component to
  resolve as a directory, while `mkdir("newdir/")` still uses the parent of
  `newdir`.
- `..` at a VFS mount root resolves to the parent mount instead of being
  treated as an escape from the host-backed mount.
- Empty pathnames now fail with `ENOENT` instead of resolving to the current
  directory.
- `getcwd(2)` validates that the current working directory still exists and
  returns `ENOENT` after it is removed.
- `chdir(2)` stores a canonical current working directory after successful
  component-wise resolution, so later `getcwd(2)` does not expose literal `.`
  or `..` path components.
- Host-backed absolute symlinks that point inside their guest mount are
  followed for `stat`/`open` while `readlink` still returns the original guest
  target text.
- BSD `flock(2)` locks are open-file-description locks. `LOCK_SH` is allowed
  on write-only descriptors, separate opens in the same process conflict, and
  `LOCK_NB` returns `EAGAIN` instead of being retried as a blocking syscall.
- PHPT section semantics now match upstream more closely: test `--INI--` is
  applied to `--FILE--` only, stable generated names are used for `--FILE--`
  and `--CLEAN--`, `--INI--` assignment whitespace is normalized, `{PWD}` in
  `--INI--`/`--ENV--` expands to the guest test directory, PHP-style trim
  removes edge NUL bytes for EXPECT matching, PHPT source/output bytes are
  preserved instead of UTF-8 decoded, EXPECTF `%r...%r` regex spans and
  percent placeholders follow upstream substitution ordering, flaky PHPTs retry
  once, matching tests after SKIPIF `warn` output are classified `WARN`, and a
  warned mismatch retains failure status plus warning context so the aggregate
  command cannot hide the mismatch. Selected upstream control env vars such as
  `SKIP_SLOW_TESTS` pass through to guest PHP.
- Kandelo deliberately reports a passing PHP `--XFAIL--` as `XPASS` and makes
  it fail the harness command. Upstream PHP 8.3 reports that case as `WARN`;
  Kandelo's stricter policy keeps stale expected-failure annotations visible.
- Stream/socket behavior now covers the standard cases exercised by PHP's
  stream suite: abstract AF_UNIX addresses are not filesystem-backed, UDP
  `INADDR_ANY` destinations route to loopback, AF_INET6 loopback sockaddrs are
  round-tripped, accepted sockets preserve Kandelo's nonblocking status
  contract, and malformed numeric IPv4 names fail resolution instead of being
  treated as browser synthetic DNS names.
- Additional network PHPT coverage now passes for AF_UNIX datagram loopback,
  AF_INET6 UDP loopback, and browser-side rejection of syntactically invalid
  DNS names instead of assigning synthetic addresses to them.

## 2026-06-02 SQLite Allocator Status

After rebasing onto `origin/main` at `2e6293a50ccf996b1a434aa701057b862a46c587`,
the next official SQLite Node-host run reached 77/1416 jobs and 22419 SQLite
cases with 0 case errors before repeated wasm `unreachable` traps appeared in
path-heavy `stat`/`lstat` calls.

The trap mapped to the wasm kernel allocator path, not to SQLite itself:
`crates/kernel/src/lib.rs` used a global bump allocator whose `dealloc` was a
no-op. Temporary Rust allocations such as `Vec` allocations in path
normalization were leaked for the lifetime of the centralized kernel. Long
official SQLite runs therefore exhausted the kernel heap.

The wasm kernel now uses a lock-protected `dlmalloc::Dlmalloc` global allocator
with real `dealloc`, `alloc_zeroed`, and `realloc`. Validation so far:

- Wasm kernel release build passed.
- Host build passed.
- Host typecheck passed.
- Focused official SQLite Node run of `savepoint6.test`,
  `fts5origintext5.test`, `fts5ah.test`, and `sort4.test` completed 3/4 jobs
  before a 10 minute outer timeout: 10189 SQLite cases, 0 case errors.
- The incomplete focused job was `test/sort4.test`, which is marked
  `TESTRUNNER: superslow`; it was still running, not failed.

This fixes the immediate kernel heap leak/allocator exhaustion class. It does
not yet provide a complete SQLite `full` pass/fail matrix.

## 2026-06-03 SQLite Retry Status

Current focus remains official SQLite `full`, not SpiderMonkey. The Node-host
run was restarted after three root-cause fixes:

- Stale file-backed `MAP_SHARED` tracking after page-rounded `munmap` could
  corrupt anonymous mappings reused at the same address. This reproduced in
  `test/wal.test`; direct rerun now passes 581/581 cases.
- Rapid pthread create/join loops could exhaust the 16 reserved thread slots
  because slots were freed only after a later JS worker message. Slots are now
  reclaimed when the kernel confirms thread `SYS_EXIT`. Direct `sort4.test`
  now passes 11/11 without slot-exhaustion output, and the new
  `thread-slot-reuse` regression creates/joins 64 threads successfully.
- The next full `--jobs 4` run reached 74/1416 jobs before the official
  runner's own `testrunner.db` became genuinely malformed. The corrupt DB had
  zero-filled low pages, including the jobs table root page and the overflow
  page for the `CREATE TABLE jobs` schema record. The root cause was that
  centralized direct handlers for large `write`/`pwrite` and `writev`/`pwritev`
  bypassed the normal post-syscall shared-backing update path. A stale
  file-backed mapping cache could then flush or expose zero pages after the
  real file had been written. Those direct handlers now update and refresh
  shared backings before unblocking the guest. Regression:
  `examples/mmap_shared_large_pwrite.c`.

Focused validation now passing on Node:

- `host/test/mmap-shared.test.ts`: 3 passed, 1 skipped.
- `host/test/pthread.test.ts`: 3 passed.
- Direct official SQLite jobs: `wal.test` 581/581, `writecrash.test` 995/995,
  `rtree4.test` 112471/112471, `sort4.test` 11/11, and
  `fts5optimize2.test` 4/4.

Live official run:
`test-runs/sqlite-full-node-j4-after-large-write-sync-20260603-151517`.
Latest recorded stdout progress is at least 364/1416 jobs (25.71%), past the
previous 74-job malformed-DB blocker, with no visible SQLite case errors or
Kandelo runtime failures. Live DB reads are intentionally avoided while the
guest runner owns the WAL-mode control database; case counts are taken from
`testrunner.log` snapshots until the run finishes.

## 2026-06-02 SQLite Official Status

Detailed report: `docs/sqlite-official-test-report.md`.

The answer to "do we know exactly what parts of the full SQLite suite pass and
fail on Kandelo?" is currently no. We know the official inventory and we have
targeted official job results, but neither the Node nor browser host can yet
finish `full --jobs 1` and produce a trustworthy complete runner database.

The most important blocker is file-backed `MAP_SHARED` coherency. Kandelo
currently populates file-backed mappings by copying file bytes into each guest
process memory and writes mapped bytes back on `msync`/`munmap`. SQLite WAL
uses a file-backed `test.db-shm` mapping as live shared memory and does not
depend on `msync` for WAL-index coherence. That makes the observed
`busy2.test`, `wal3.test`, and `walsetlk.test` failures kernel/filesystem
correctness failures to fix before treating full SQLite numbers as meaningful.

Other known blockers are the browser `SharedFS` 64-FD cap reducing
`manydb.test`, a SQLite testfixture build mismatch around
`SQLITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT`, and a browser artifact bug where the
timeboxed full run exported a valid 1024-byte SQLite DB with no `jobs` table.

## 2026-06-01 SQLite Rebase Status

The branch was rebased onto `origin/main` at
`95e31d2588e8fa7653796e0245c023f26fc59556` ("Reduce initial process memory
allocation"). The old branch was preserved as
`backup/prove-by-guest-software-tests-pre-main-rebase-20260601`.

The rebase plus current work fixed the immediate SQLite kernel trap found after
the main memory-layout changes:

- The first post-rebase full SQLite run failed in the kernel on `munmap`.
  The root issue was `MemoryManager::munmap` rebuilding the entire mapping
  table into a fresh `Vec` on every unmap; in the wasm kernel, allocation
  failure/panic becomes `unreachable`.
- `MemoryManager::munmap` now updates mappings in place, preserves existing
  mapping-table storage for non-splitting unmaps, and propagates `ENOMEM` only
  if a middle split cannot reserve one extra slot.
- Validation: native kernel unit tests passed 866/866; focused host lifecycle
  regressions passed 14/14; the targeted SQLite repro set
  (`capi2.test`, `avtrans.test`, `temptable2.test`, `backup_malloc.test`)
  passed 4/4 jobs and 2572/2572 cases with 0 errors in
  `test-runs/main-rebase-full/20260601-155813-sqlite-targeted/`.

The next full Node-host official SQLite run was stopped, not completed:

- Run root:
  `test-runs/main-rebase-full/20260601-160004-sqlite-full-node/`.
- At stop time the database had 1394 total jobs, 45 done, 91 failed,
  4 running, 1254 ready, 8183 reported cases, and 4554 case errors.
- The run log had no `handleSyscall kernel threw` or wasm out-of-bounds lines.
  It did include one guest `testfixture.wasm` `unreachable` from pid 499; the
  parent testrunner continued afterward, so this is not currently classified as
  the same kernel-fatal class as the earlier `munmap` trap.
- The dominant remaining failure pattern is SQLite-level `database is locked`
  output. A serial subset rerun with `--jobs 1` reduced five previously noisy
  failures to 5 jobs, 267 cases, and 3 case errors:
  `test-runs/main-rebase-full/20260601-160321-sqlite-failed-subset-j1/`.
  In that subset, `tkt3731.test`, `func4.test`, and `vacuum5.test` passed;
  `writecrash.test` still failed with `database is locked`, and `upfrom4.test`
  still failed two SQL-result cases.

Official SQLite suite inventory after the `getdents64` fix:

- The large SQLite test suite is defined by upstream
  `packages/registry/sqlite/sqlite-full-src/test/testrunner.tcl`, with Tcl
  file sets from `test/permutations.test` and the `all` config list from
  `test/testrunner_data.tcl`.
- `full` means the full Tcl file set. Current explain plans queue 1416 Tcl
  jobs on both Node and browser hosts:
  `test-runs/main-rebase-full/20260601-212612-sqlite-full-explain-node-getdents-fix/`
  and
  `test-runs/main-rebase-full/20260601-212612-sqlite-full-explain-browser-getdents-fix/`.
- `all` means `full` plus SQLite's official config permutations. Current
  explain plans queue 10523 Tcl jobs on both Node and browser hosts:
  `test-runs/main-rebase-full/20260601-212633-sqlite-all-explain-node-getdents-fix/`
  and
  `test-runs/main-rebase-full/20260601-212657-sqlite-all-explain-browser-getdents-fix/`.
  The largest config groups are `full` 1416, `memsubsys1` 1329,
  `memsubsys2` 1330, `no_mutex_try` 1331, `inmemory_journal` 1256,
  `journaltest` 1164, `prepare` 1221, and `mmap` 1224.
- SQLite's "around 300,000 tests" figure refers to the internal case counts
  each Tcl job reports as `N errors out of M tests`. Those counts are not known
  from `--explain`; they are aggregated into `testrunner.db` as jobs execute.
  Earlier stopped official `full` runs had already reported 586267, 836413,
  and 839152 cases before completion, so the official path is the path that
  reaches the hundreds-of-thousands case count.
- `scripts/run-software-unit-tests.sh` now runs SQLite through the official
  testrunner by default. Set `SQLITE_OFFICIAL_PERMUTATION=all` to run the
  wider permutation set.

The earlier 1394/1393 `full` explain counts were wrong. The VFS image
contained the missing files, but the kernel consumed a host directory entry
before checking whether the guest `getdents64` buffer had room for it. If the
entry did not fit, the syscall returned without preserving that entry, so the
next `getdents64` call skipped it. `OpenFileDesc` now carries one pending
directory entry across calls, `lseek(SEEK_SET)` clears that pending entry, and
`sys_getdents64` advances the directory offset only after successfully writing
an entry to guest memory. The regressions
`test_getdents64_keeps_entry_that_does_not_fit` and
`test_getdents64_resumes_synthetic_entries_after_full_buffer` cover these
boundary cases.

The next official Node `full --jobs 1` run was intentionally stopped before
completion:

- Run root:
  `test-runs/main-rebase-full/20260601-220000-sqlite-full-node-j1-getdents-synth-fix/`.
- At stop time it had 1416 jobs queued, 17 done, 1 failed, 1 running,
  1397 ready, 102908 reported SQLite cases, and 10 case errors.
- The failed job was `test/busy2.test`. Its first two failures showed
  `PRAGMA journal_mode = wal` returning `delete`. That was an invalid Kandelo
  artifact, not an upstream-suite issue: `packages/registry/sqlite/build-sqlite.sh`
  and `packages/registry/sqlite/build-testfixture.sh` both used
  `-DSQLITE_OMIT_WAL`.
- The no-WAL flag has been removed from both builds. `sqlite3.wasm`,
  `testfixture.wasm`, and `apps/browser-demos/public/sqlite-test.vfs.zst`
  were rebuilt with WAL enabled.
- Targeted validation through the official runner:
  `test-runs/sqlite-official-node-full/20260601-213948/` ran
  `busy2.test` and reduced the failure to 4 errors out of 29 cases. WAL mode
  now works; the remaining failures are checkpoint/accounting differences:
  expected `wal_checkpoint` results such as `{0 4 3}` are observed as
  `{0 4 0}` or `{0 3 3}`.

The remaining `busy2.test` failures expose a real platform bug, not a harness
problem. SQLite WAL uses byte-range locks plus a file-backed `MAP_SHARED`
mapping of `test.db-shm` as live shared memory. Kandelo currently populates a
file-backed mapping by copying file bytes into each process memory and writes
MAP_SHARED data back only on `msync` or `munmap`. That is not coherent shared
memory between separately allocated guest process memories. SQLite does not
use `msync` for its WAL index, so separate processes can observe stale
wal-index state even though fcntl byte locks are visible. The root fix is to
implement sound file-backed `MAP_SHARED` coherency across processes, then rerun
`busy2.test` and restart the full official SQLite run.

SpiderMonkey official tests remain paused until the SQLite/kernel reliability
work is stable. The previous SpiderMonkey official Node path did not include
browser-host official execution, so it is not counted as proof for the
platform.

## 2026-05-29 SQLite/SpiderMonkey Status

SpiderMonkey official tests are intentionally paused. The browser host still
allocates a full 1 GiB shared WebAssembly memory per guest process because the
syscall channel is placed near max memory. That must be fixed in the memory
layout, not worked around in the harness, before official SpiderMonkey browser
numbers are meaningful.

SQLite official `full` on the Node host is the active focus:

- `test-runs/sqlite-official-node-full-thread-ceiling/20260529-142042/`
  was stopped after the old Node crash path wedged parent `waitpid`. The DB
  had 1394 jobs, 560 done, 21 failed, 4 running, 809 ready, 586267 reported
  test cases, and 451 case errors.
- `test-runs/sqlite-official-node-full-crash-reap-fix/20260529-155403/`
  progressed further, then was stopped on a kernel wasm `memory access out of
  bounds` while `waitpid` reaped a child through `kernel_remove_process`. After
  the process was stopped, the DB passed `pragma integrity_check` and reported
  1394 jobs, 873 done, 41 failed, 4 running, 476 ready, 836413 reported test
  cases, and 617 case errors.
- The kernel allocator now records allocation metadata and coalesces free-list
  overlaps defensively instead of deriving the free interval from the caller's
  layout. The Node worker crash path now ignores duplicate error notifications
  after the process has already been removed from the host process map.
- Validation after those fixes: kernel memory-manager unit tests passed 20/20,
  `host/test/wasm-trap.test.ts` passed 3/3, and a targeted official SQLite run
  of `fallocate.test` and `select7.test` failed cleanly with 2 reported case
  errors instead of hanging.
- `test-runs/sqlite-official-node-full-allocator-fix/20260529-173059/`
  reached 1394 jobs total, 875 done, 39 failed, 4 running, 476 ready,
  839152 reported test cases, and 612 case errors before it was stopped. The
  first kernel failure was again `RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds`
  during `kernel_remove_process` from `consumeExitedChild()` while handling
  `waitpid`; active jobs were `pagerfault2.test`, `analyzeE.test`,
  `fts3fault.test`, and `backup_ioerr.test`.
- The new OOB mapped to a `memory.copy` inside Rust's BTreeMap removal of a
  large `Process` value. The most plausible root cause found so far was a
  wasm-only allocator bug: allocations carved from a free block could leave the
  suffix `FreeNode` at an unaligned `user + requested` address. That alignment
  bug is now patched, and deallocation rejects unaligned allocation metadata.
  This is under validation, not yet proven by a complete SQLite `full` run.
- Validation after the alignment patch: full native kernel tests passed
  850/850, `host/test/wasm-trap.test.ts` passed 3/3, and a targeted official
  SQLite run for `pagerfault2.test`, `analyzeE.test`, `fts3fault.test`, and
  `backup_ioerr.test` is running under
  `test-runs/sqlite-official-node-reap-oob-regression/20260529-193249/`.

SQLite's upstream testrunner repeatedly prints
`WARNING: Multi-threaded tests skipped: Linked against a non-threadsafe Tcl build`.
Those skipped Tcl-threaded cases are a caveat on all current SQLite official
numbers.

## Important Corrections

The previous status overstated two areas:

- The `scripts/run-spidermonkey-unit-tests.sh` runner is not the official
  Mozilla SpiderMonkey suite. It is a Kandelo smoke suite that exercises shell
  builtins, Intl, workers, Atomics, file APIs, GC pressure, promises, and error
  handling. Mozilla's official shell suites are `js/src/tests/jstests.py` and
  `js/src/jit-test/jit_test.py`.
- The SQLite results counted Tcl test scripts, not individual SQLite test
  cases. SQLite's own documentation distinguishes `veryquick`, `full`, `all`,
  and `release`: `full` is all Tcl scripts, `all` is `full` plus permutations,
  and `release` runs many build configurations plus fuzz/thread/mptest-style
  work. The completed Kandelo runs executed the 1159 Tcl scripts once; they did
  not run SQLite's official `all` or `release` permutations.

`scripts/run-sqlite-upstream-tests.sh` and the browser SQLite runner now parse
and aggregate the internal `N errors out of M tests` counts for future runs.
The 2026-05-28 logs do not contain the per-script stdout needed to reconstruct
the exact SQLite case count after the fact.

## Entry Points

```bash
# Default pragmatic suite set on both hosts. SpiderMonkey here is the smoke
# suite because official browser-host SpiderMonkey is not wired yet.
scripts/run-software-unit-tests.sh

# Run one host.
scripts/run-software-unit-tests.sh --host node
scripts/run-software-unit-tests.sh --host browser

# Run selected suites. `mysql` is accepted as an alias for MariaDB.
scripts/run-software-unit-tests.sh --host browser sqlite php nodejs
scripts/run-software-unit-tests.sh --host node mariadb spidermonkey-official
```

| Suite | Node.js host | Browser host |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| MariaDB / mysql-test | `scripts/run-mariadb-tests.sh --all` | `scripts/run-browser-mariadb-tests.sh --all` |
| SQLite direct Tcl scripts | `scripts/run-sqlite-upstream-tests.sh --all` | `scripts/run-browser-sqlite-upstream-tests.sh --all` |
| SQLite official testrunner | `scripts/run-sqlite-official-tests.sh --host node --permutation full` | `scripts/run-sqlite-official-tests.sh --host browser --permutation full` |
| PHP PHPT runtime tests | `scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --all` | `scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host browser --all` |

PHP PHPT harness notes:

```bash
# Full php-src PHPT run (all discovered .phpt files).
scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --all
scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host browser --all

# Smoke/debug a prefix or selector and emit machine-readable results.
scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --limit 25 --json
scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host browser Zend/tests/001.phpt --json

# Split a full sorted discovery set for lower-memory CI or AO shards.
scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --all --shard 1/16 --json
scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host browser --all --offset 500 --limit 100 --json

# Write docs/php-upstream-test-report.md for the selected host/run.
scripts/run-php-upstream-tests.sh --host node --all --report
```

The PHPT harness writes the generated `--FILE--` section as the upstream
`<test-name>.php` beside each `.phpt` file, then restores any pre-existing file.
This matches php-src's `run-tests.php` behavior for tests that assert `__FILE__`
or exception source locations. Browser runs use the same generated path inside
the `/php-src` VFS image and start a temporary Vite server; set
`PHP_TEST_VITE_PORT` if port `5201` is occupied. Browser PHPT runs pass Chromium
Wasm stack-switching flags by default so stack-heavy guest workloads get a
larger secondary Wasm stack in dedicated workers. Add extra browser flags with
`PHP_TEST_CHROMIUM_ARGS` or `KANDELO_CHROMIUM_ARGS`; set
`PHP_TEST_DISABLE_BROWSER_WASM_STACK_FLAGS=1` only when debugging those default
stack settings.

The runner also mirrors `run-tests.php` comparison and working-directory
semantics: CRLF is normalized and both actual and expected output are trimmed
before comparison, `EXPECTF` placeholders include php-src's `%r...%r` regex and
`%0` NUL forms, and each PHP process runs with `TEST_PHP_SRCDIR` as its current
directory so source-root-relative paths such as `./ext/standard/tests/file`
behave like upstream.

## Official SpiderMonkey

The official Node-host path uses Mozilla's Python harnesses with an executable
shim at `scripts/kandelo-js-shell-wrapper.sh`. The shim is passed to the
official harness as the `js` shell, but it runs `packages/registry/spidermonkey/bin/js.wasm`
inside Kandelo via `examples/run-example.ts`.

`jstests.py` is run with shell WPT disabled by default
(`SPIDERMONKEY_OFFICIAL_WPT=disabled`) because the local Firefox source tree is
missing some Python import path setup needed by the WPT manifest updater. Set
`SPIDERMONKEY_OFFICIAL_WPT=enabled` after that dependency path is fixed.

```bash
# One small official smoke from each Mozilla harness.
scripts/run-spidermonkey-official-tests.sh --suite both --smoke

# Full official JS shell tests.
scripts/run-spidermonkey-official-tests.sh --suite jstests
scripts/run-spidermonkey-official-tests.sh --suite jit-tests
scripts/run-spidermonkey-official-tests.sh --suite both

# Pass jstests path selectors after --.
scripts/run-spidermonkey-official-tests.sh --suite jstests -- non262/Array/array-001.js
```

Browser-host official SpiderMonkey remains open work. The browser would need a
persistent Playwright/Vite bridge or a browser-native implementation of the
Mozilla harness command scheduling, plus a VFS image containing the official
`js/src/tests` and `js/src/jit-test` trees.

## SQLite Scope

There are now two SQLite paths:

- Direct script runner: runs each `test/*.test` file once through `testfixture`.
  This is the runner used for the completed Node and browser results above.
- Official testrunner: invokes SQLite's upstream `test/testrunner.tcl` for
  `veryquick`, `full`, or `all` on the Node or browser host. A `full main.test`
  smoke run completed with `0 errors out of 95 tests`.

```bash
# Direct runner, one pass over test/*.test.
scripts/run-sqlite-upstream-tests.sh --all
scripts/run-browser-sqlite-upstream-tests.sh --all

# Official upstream testrunner permutations.
scripts/run-sqlite-official-tests.sh --host node --permutation veryquick
scripts/run-sqlite-official-tests.sh --host node --permutation full
scripts/run-sqlite-official-tests.sh --host node --permutation all
scripts/run-sqlite-official-tests.sh --host browser --permutation full

# Explain planned official work without running it.
scripts/run-sqlite-official-tests.sh --host node --permutation all --explain
```

SQLite `release`, `mdevtest`, and `sdevtest` are not wired as Kandelo guest
runs yet because they require rebuilding multiple host configurations and
running additional fuzz/thread/mptest binaries.

## Prerequisites

Build or fetch `kernel.wasm` before running any browser or Node suite:

```bash
bash build.sh
# or
scripts/fetch-binaries.sh
```

MariaDB needs `mariadbd`, `mysqltest.wasm`, and the `mysql-test/` tree:

```bash
bash packages/registry/mariadb/build-mariadb.sh
```

SQLite needs Tcl, SQLite, and the testfixture binary:

```bash
bash packages/registry/tcl/build-tcl.sh
bash packages/registry/sqlite/build-sqlite.sh
bash packages/registry/sqlite/build-testfixture.sh
```

PHP needs the CLI wasm binary. The PHPT source tree is taken from
`PHP_SOURCE_DIR`, a local `packages/registry/php/php-src`, or the package
source tarball:

```bash
bash packages/registry/php/build-php.sh
```

SpiderMonkey needs the standalone JS shell wasm binary:

```bash
bash packages/registry/spidermonkey/build-spidermonkey.sh
```

Node.js library tests use the SpiderMonkey-backed `node.wasm` package and the
upstream Node.js source tree. By default the runner downloads the source bundle
matching the host `node` version and verifies it with Node.js `SHASUMS256.txt`;
override with `NODEJS_TEST_VERSION` or `NODEJS_SOURCE_DIR`:

```bash
bash packages/registry/spidermonkey-node/build-spidermonkey-node.sh
scripts/run-nodejs-library-tests.sh --host node --list
```

Browser runs build suite-specific VFS images under
`apps/browser-demos/public/` when missing:

```bash
bash images/vfs/scripts/build-sqlite-test-vfs-image.sh
bash images/vfs/scripts/build-php-test-vfs-image.sh
bash images/vfs/scripts/build-spidermonkey-test-vfs-image.sh
bash images/vfs/scripts/build-nodejs-test-vfs-image.sh
```
