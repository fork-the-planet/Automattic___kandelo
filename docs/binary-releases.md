# Binary releases

Prebuilt Wasm binaries — the kernel, userspace stub, user programs,
and library archives — live in GitHub Releases rather than the Git repo. This
keeps the repo small and makes rebuilds optional for contributors:
fetch once, use everywhere.

The flow is **per-package + index-ledger**: every release tag carries
a single `index.toml` ledger that records every published archive's
URL + sha + cache-key. Each `packages/registry/<name>/build.toml` points
its `[binary]` entry at that ledger (typically via `index_url` with a
`{abi}` placeholder so one `build.toml` survives ABI bumps).

Adding or rebuilding one package re-uploads that package's `.tar.zst`
**and** updates exactly that package's entry in `index.toml` —
atomically, under a workflow-level state-lock so concurrent
matrix-build jobs serialize their writes to the same ledger without
clobbering each other.

See [docs/plans/2026-05-13-binary-resolution-via-index-ledger-design.md](plans/2026-05-13-binary-resolution-via-index-ledger-design.md)
for the design rationale and [docs/package-management.md](package-management.md)
for the resolver behavior, schema, and build-script contract.

## Producer side: the matrix flow

Every staging-build run (PR push or `workflow_dispatch`) follows the
same matrix flow in `.github/workflows/staging-build.yml`. After this
PR's [Phase 10 workflow rewrite](plans/2026-05-13-binary-resolution-via-index-ledger-plan.md):

```
preflight → toolchain-cache → matrix-build → test-gate → merge-gate
```

- **preflight** computes the build matrix. For each package with a
  `[build]` block, for each declared `arches = [...]` entry, it
  runs `xtask compute-cache-key-sha`. If the resulting
  `<pkg>-<ver>-rev<N>-abi<N>-<arch>-<short8>.tar.zst` filename is
  already an asset on the target release tag, the entry is dropped
  (already published, nothing to rebuild). Otherwise it lands in
  the matrix.
- **toolchain-cache** does a one-shot build of the wasm32 + wasm64
  musl sysroot + libc++ headers, uploads them as a workflow
  artifact, and saves the same content into actions/cache. The
  cache key is content-addressed over the sysroot recipe + musl
  submodule SHA, so toolchain churn is rare.
- **matrix-build** runs once per `(package, arch)` matrix entry.
  Per-entry steps:
  1. Download the toolchain artifact.
  2. Run `xtask archive-stage` to produce the per-entry `.tar.zst`
     (pinned commit-bound `--build-timestamp` + `--build-host`).
  3. Invoke `scripts/index-update.sh --target-tag <tag> --package
     <name> --version <v> --revision <r> --arch <a> --status success
     --archive-path <staged> --archive-name <n> --cache-key-sha <s>`.
     The script acquires the state-lock for `<tag>`, downloads the
     current `index.toml` (or bootstraps an empty one for a fresh
     tag), runs `xtask index-update` to mutate this package's entry,
     uploads the archive + new `index.toml` with `--clobber`, and
     releases the lock.
  4. On failure: a separate `if: failure()` step runs
     `scripts/index-update.sh --status failed --error <msg>` so the
     ledger reflects the failure. If a prior successful build for
     this `(name, version, arch)` exists in the entry, it's
     preserved in `fallback_archive_url` — consumers can keep
     using the last-green archive while CI iterates on the rebuild.
- **test-gate** materializes the full `binaries/` tree by running
  `scripts/fetch-binaries.sh` — which now reads `build.toml`'s
  `index_url`, fetches `index.toml` from the target release, and
  resolves each `(package, arch)` from the ledger. Then the standard
  test suite runs: `cargo test`, `vitest`, libc-test, POSIX, sortix.
- **merge-gate** posts `merge-gate=success` on the PR's HEAD SHA
  once test-gate passes. No bot-PR amend step exists anymore — the
  ledger on the release IS the consumer-visible state, so there's
  nothing in-tree to amend.

`prepare-merge.yml` (triggered by the `ready-to-ship` label) reuses
the same shape but targets the durable `binaries-abi-v<N>` tag.
`force-rebuild.yml` is the manual escape hatch (`workflow_dispatch`)
for republishing selected packages.

## State-lock serialization

`scripts/index-update.sh` acquires the workflow-level state-lock
before mutating `index.toml`. The lock ref is per-subject:

```
refs/heads/github-actions/state-lock/<subject>
```

Where `<subject>` is the target release tag (`binaries-abi-v8`,
`pr-447-staging`, etc.). Different tags → different subjects →
independent locks, so concurrent rebuilds for the durable release
don't block per-PR staging publishes and vice versa.

The lock uses the existing stale-detection mechanism inherited from
`durable-release-lock.sh` (run-ID-based + 6h time fallback), so a
crashed workflow can't leave a wedged lock indefinitely.

## Release tag convention

```
binaries-abi-v<ABI_VERSION>
```

The tag is **mutable** — new packages and arches are added as new
assets over time. What's *immutable* is each archive: its filename
encodes the `cache_key_sha` of the build inputs, so a published
asset's bytes never change. Different inputs → different filename.

PR-staging releases use `pr-<NNN>-staging` (also mutable, but
ephemeral — closed PRs leave them as historical curios).

The ABI version appears in the tag because a release is tied to a
specific kernel ABI. Programs from `binaries-abi-v7` cannot run
against a kernel on ABI 8 — the resolver's compatibility check
rejects them.

## Layout of a release

Flat asset namespace. Per-package archive filenames + one
`index.toml` ledger.

```
binaries-abi-v8 (release)
├── index.toml                                              ← LEDGER (the contract)
├── kernel-0.1.0-rev1-abi8-wasm64-0a51ff38.tar.zst          ← kernel.wasm
├── userspace-0.1.0-rev1-abi8-wasm64-6fbf3622.tar.zst       ← userspace.wasm

├── vim-9.1.0900-rev2-abi8-wasm32-0e8b5c34.tar.zst          ← program
└── …
```

Filename schema:
`<name>-<version>-rev<N>-abi<N>-<arch>-<short-cache-key-sha>.tar.zst`,
where `short-cache-key-sha` is the first 8 chars of the cache-key
sha for that manifest. Two archives with the same `(name, version,
revision, arch)` but different transitive deps get distinct shas
and thus distinct names.

### Archive interior layout

Each `.tar.zst` carries exactly two top-level entries:

```
manifest.toml              ← source package.toml + injected revision + [compatibility]
artifacts/                 ← cache-tree contents
    lib/libz.a
    include/zlib.h
    include/zconf.h
    lib/pkgconfig/zlib.pc
```

The consumer (`xtask build-deps resolve`, calling
`remote_fetch::fetch_and_install_direct`) flattens `artifacts/*` to
the cache root after extraction. See
[docs/package-management.md](package-management.md) "Release
archives" for the full producer/consumer round-trip and the
`[compatibility]` block.

## `index.toml`: the contract

`index.toml` is the **single source of truth** for binary resolution.
The resolver fetches it (with offline cache fallback at
`~/.cache/wasm-posix-kernel/indexes/`), looks up
`(name, version, arch)`, and decides which archive to install based
on the entry's `status`.

Schema (see [design §3.4](plans/2026-05-13-binary-resolution-via-index-ledger-design.md#34-indextoml--ledger-of-build-state)):

```toml
abi_version = 8
generated_at = "2026-05-13T..."
generator = "wasm-posix-kernel CI @ <sha>"

[[packages]]
name     = "zlib"
version  = "1.3.1"
revision = 1

[packages.binary.wasm32]
status         = "success"
archive_url    = "zlib-1.3.1-rev1-abi8-wasm32-e33c5e9a.tar.zst"
archive_sha256 = "<64-hex>"
cache_key_sha  = "<64-hex>"
built_at       = "2026-05-13T..."
built_by       = "https://github.com/.../actions/runs/<id>"

[packages.binary.wasm64]
status              = "failed"
error               = "linker: libc++abi missing for wasm64 toolchain"
last_attempt        = "2026-05-13T..."
last_attempt_by     = "https://github.com/.../actions/runs/<id>"
# Last-green fallback: the previous successful build, preserved across
# the failed rebuild.
fallback_archive_url    = "zlib-1.3.1-rev1-abi8-wasm64-87766332.tar.zst"
fallback_archive_sha256 = "<64-hex>"
fallback_cache_key_sha  = "<64-hex>"
fallback_built_at       = "2026-05-12T..."
```

### Status semantics

| Value | Meaning | Resolver behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `success` | Latest build succeeded; current archive fields are authoritative | Fetch `archive_url`, verify, install |
| `failed` | Latest build failed; `error` describes why | Use `fallback_*` if present; else fall through to source build |
| `pending` / `building` | Transient (rebuild queued or in flight) | Use `fallback_*` if present; else source build |

### Last-green fallback

When a per-package rebuild for `(name, version, arch)` fails, the
prior successful `archive_url` / `archive_sha256` / `cache_key_sha`
move into the entry's `fallback_*` slots — consumers keep fetching
the last working archive while CI iterates on the rebuild. A
subsequent success clears the fallback (`update_entry_success`
overwrites current fields and clears `fallback_*`). A repeated
failure does NOT overwrite the fallback (it's the only working copy;
preserved across multiple consecutive failures).

## Per-package binary source: `build.toml`

`packages/registry/<pkg>/build.toml` declares where the resolver fetches
this package's binaries from. Typical shape:

```toml
script_path = "packages/registry/zlib/build-zlib.sh"
repo_url    = "https://github.com/brandonpayton/wasm-posix-kernel.git"
commit      = "<commit at last successful build>"
revision    = 1

[binary]
index_url = "https://github.com/brandonpayton/wasm-posix-kernel/releases/download/binaries-abi-v{abi}/index.toml"
```

- `{abi}` is substituted with the current `ABI_VERSION` at resolve
  time, so one `build.toml` survives ABI bumps.
- `revision` is the publish-time counter the resolver hashes into
  the cache-key — bump it when output bytes legitimately change.
- For a legacy archive that doesn't live in an index, replace the
  `index_url` line with `url = "https://..."` + `sha256 = "..."`.
  The resolver fetches that archive directly without consulting any
  `index.toml`.

A `package.toml` without a sibling `build.toml` is treated as
source-build-only (kernel, userspace, examples, source-kind
metadata packages) — the resolver source-builds via
`scripts/dev-shell.sh` instead of fetching.

## PR overlays: `package.pr.toml`

The legacy PR-overlay mechanism still exists for one-off local
swaps: a sibling `packages/registry/<pkg>/package.pr.toml` injects
`[binary.<arch>]` entries into the parsed `DepsManifest` at load
time (see `apply_pr_overlay` in `tools/xtask/src/pkg_manifest.rs`).
Gitignored.

For CI-driven PR testing, the matrix flow uses a dedicated
`pr-<NNN>-staging` release tag instead: that tag has its own
`index.toml` (separate state-lock subject from the durable
release), and a PR's `build.toml` either points at the staging
index temporarily or the consumer manually overrides `index_url`
via the overlay path.

## Consumer: `scripts/fetch-binaries.sh`

```bash
bash scripts/fetch-binaries.sh
```

Walks every `packages/registry/<pkg>/` that has a `build.toml` and runs:

```
cargo run -p xtask -- build-deps --arch <arch> \
    --binaries-dir <repo>/binaries resolve <pkg>
```

For each declared arch in the package's `arches = [...]` (default
`["wasm32"]`). The resolver:

1. Reads `package.toml` (recipe) + `build.toml` (project view) from
   `packages/registry/<pkg>/`. `revision` from `build.toml` overrides
   the `DepsManifest`'s default revision before cache-key
   computation.
2. Resolves `build.toml`'s `[binary]`:
   - Indexed form: fetches `index.toml` (with offline cache
     fallback), looks up `(name, version, arch)`, picks
     `archive_url` (status=success) or `fallback_archive_url`
     (status=failed/pending/building with fallback set).
   - Direct form: uses the inline `url` + `sha256`.
3. Fetches the archive into the content-addressed cache at
   `~/.cache/wasm-posix-kernel/...`.
4. Verifies `archive_sha256` against the file bytes.
5. Verifies the embedded `manifest.toml`'s `[compatibility]` block:
   - `target_arch` must match the requested arch.
   - `abi_versions` must contain the in-tree `ABI_VERSION`.
   - `cache_key_sha` must match the resolver's locally-computed
     cache-key sha (catches recipe drift).
6. Places `binaries/programs/<arch>/<output>.wasm` symlinks pointing
   into the cache, so browser/Node demos can load by relative path
   without re-fetching.

On any verification failure, the resolver logs a warning and falls
through to a source build (the package's build script). This
makes ABI bumps and rev bumps non-fatal: as long as the source-build
path works, missing archives just slow the first run.

## Cache eviction

The cache is content-addressed. A different `archive_url` ⇒ a
different canonical path under `~/.cache/wasm-posix-kernel/`. Old
entries are never overwritten; they're orphaned. Disk-pressure
cleanup is the user's responsibility — no automated GC today.

The `index.toml` cache (`~/.cache/wasm-posix-kernel/indexes/`) is
keyed on the sha8 of the index URL, so different sources land in
distinct files. Each successful online fetch overwrites the cached
copy.

## Reproducibility

`xtask archive-stage` requires `--build-timestamp <ISO>` and
`--build-host <s>`. Both are pinned to commit-bound values in CI
(commit author date for timestamp, `<repo>@<sha>` for host) so
re-running the same SHA at any wall-clock time produces
byte-identical archives. This is load-bearing: test-gate re-installs
the same archives that publish later uploads, and the only way that
round-trip works is if both sides are deterministic.

The `[compatibility]` block injected into each archive's
`manifest.toml` is also a pure function of the build inputs (no
wall-clock or worker-local fields).

`index.toml` itself is also byte-deterministic for a given input
set: `IndexToml::write()` emits packages alphabetically by
`(name, version)`, per-arch entries in canonical `wasm32`→`wasm64`
order, and fields within each entry follow the design's
success-then-failure-then-fallback grouping.

## ABI bumps

Bumping `ABI_VERSION` in `crates/shared/src/lib.rs` invalidates every
durable archive against the resolver's ABI check. The bump PR's
matrix flow rebuilds every package whose `cache_key_sha` is now
stale (the ABI is part of the sha), and each matrix entry's
`scripts/index-update.sh` invocation atomically publishes its
archive + index entry to the new `binaries-abi-v<N+1>/` release.

Because the resolver substitutes `{abi}` in `build.toml`'s
`index_url`, no in-tree edit is required for the URL pivot — the
next fetch automatically hits the new release. The v(N) release
stays as historical state.

See [`abi-versioning.md`](abi-versioning.md) for the full ABI-bump
checklist.

## Seeding an index from existing archives

When migrating a release from the legacy schema (or recovering after
a corrupted index), `scripts/compose-initial-index.sh
<target-tag> <abi>` downloads every `.tar.zst` from the release,
extracts each archive's internal `manifest.toml` to recover
`cache_key_sha` + `build_timestamp`, and uploads a freshly composed
`index.toml`. The script acquires the same state-lock as the
matrix-build path, so it serializes against any active CI rebuilds.

Day-to-day publishes don't use this script — they go through
`scripts/index-update.sh` per-matrix-entry. compose-initial-index is
migration scaffolding kept in-tree for reproducibility.
